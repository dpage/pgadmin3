<a name="id2764800"></a><p>   Normally, PL/Perl is installed as a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">trusted</span>&#8221;</span> programming
   language named <code class="literal">plperl</code>.  In this setup, certain Perl
   operations are disabled to preserve security.  In general, the
   operations that are restricted are those that interact with the
   environment. This includes file handle operations,
   <code class="literal">require</code>, and <code class="literal">use</code> (for
   external modules).  There is no way to access internals of the
   database server process or to gain OS-level access with the
   permissions of the server process,
   as a C function can do.  Thus, any unprivileged database user may
   be permitted to use this language.
  </p>
<p>   Here is an example of a function that will not work because file
   system operations are not allowed for security reasons:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE FUNCTION badfunc() RETURNS integer AS $$
    my $tmpfile = "/tmp/badfile";
    open my $fh, '&gt;', $tmpfile
        or elog(ERROR, qq{could not open the file "$tmpfile": $!});
    print $fh "Testing writing to a file\n";
    close $fh or elog(ERROR, qq{could not close the file "$tmpfile": $!});
    return 1;
$$ LANGUAGE plperl;</pre>
<p>
    The creation of this function will fail as its use of a forbidden
    operation will be caught by the validator.
  </p>
<p>   Sometimes it is desirable to write Perl functions that are not
   restricted.  For example, one might want a Perl function that sends
   mail.  To handle these cases, PL/Perl can also be installed as an
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">untrusted</span>&#8221;</span> language (usually called
   <span class="application">PL/PerlU</span><a name="id2764886"></a>).
   In this case the full Perl language is available.  If the
   <code class="command">createlang</code> program is used to install the
   language, the language name <code class="literal">plperlu</code> will select
   the untrusted PL/Perl variant.
  </p>
<p>   The writer of a <span class="application">PL/PerlU</span> function must take care that the function
   cannot be used to do anything unwanted, since it will be able to do
   anything that could be done by a user logged in as the database
   administrator.  Note that the database system allows only database
   superusers to create functions in untrusted languages.
  </p>
<p>   If the above function was created by a superuser using the language
   <code class="literal">plperlu</code>, execution would succeed.
  </p>

<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>    While <span class="application">PL/Perl</span> functions run in a separate Perl
    interpreter for each SQL role, all <span class="application">PL/PerlU</span> functions
    executed in a given session run in a single Perl interpreter (which is
    not any of the ones used for <span class="application">PL/Perl</span> functions).
    This allows <span class="application">PL/PerlU</span> functions to share data freely,
    but no communication can occur between <span class="application">PL/Perl</span> and
    <span class="application">PL/PerlU</span> functions.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>    Perl cannot support multiple interpreters within one process unless
    it was built with the appropriate flags, namely either
    <code class="literal">usemultiplicity</code> or <code class="literal">useithreads</code>.
    (<code class="literal">usemultiplicity</code> is preferred unless you actually need
    to use threads.  For more details, see the
    <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">perlembed</span></span> man page.)
    If <span class="application">PL/Perl</span> is used with a copy of Perl that was not built
    this way, then it is only possible to have one Perl interpreter per
    session, and so any one session can only execute either
    <span class="application">PL/PerlU</span> functions, or <span class="application">PL/Perl</span> functions
    that are all called by the same SQL role.
