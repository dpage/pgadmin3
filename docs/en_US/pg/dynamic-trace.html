<a name="id2699620"></a><p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> provides facilities to support
   dynamic tracing of the database server. This allows an external
   utility to be called at specific points in the code and thereby trace
   execution.  Currently, this facility is primarily intended for use by
   database developers, as it requires substantial familiarity with the code.
  </p>
<p>   A number of trace points, often called probes, are already inserted
   into the source code.  By default these probes are disabled, and
   the user needs to explicitly tell the configure script to make the
   probes available in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.
  </p>
<p> 
   Currently, only the DTrace utility is supported, which is only available
   on Solaris Express and Solaris 10+. It is expected that DTrace will
   be available in the future on FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
   Supporting other dynamic tracing utilities is theoretically possible by
   changing the definitions for the <code class="literal">PG_TRACE</code> macros in
   <code class="filename">src/include/pg_trace.h</code>.

<p>   By default, trace points are disabled, so you will need to
   explicitly tell the configure script to make the probes available
   in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>. To include DTrace support
   specify <code class="option">--enable-dtrace</code> to configure.  See <a class="xref" href="install-procedure.html" title="14.5. Installation Procedure">Section 14.5, &#8220;Installation Procedure&#8221;</a> for further information.

<p>   The example below shows a DTrace script for analyzing transaction
   counts on the system, as an alternative to snapshotting 
   <code class="structname">pg_stat_database</code> before and after a performance test.
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -qs 

postgresql$1:::transaction-start
{
      @start["Start"] = count();
      self-&gt;ts  = timestamp;
}

postgresql$1:::transaction-abort
{
      @abort["Abort"] = count();
}

postgresql$1:::transaction-commit
/self-&gt;ts/
{
      @commit["Commit"] = count();
      @time["Total time (ns)"] = sum(timestamp - self-&gt;ts);
      self-&gt;ts=0;
}</pre>
<p>
   Note how the double underline in trace point names needs to
   be replaced by a hyphen when using D script.
   When executed, the example D script gives output such as:
</p>
<pre class="screen"># ./txn_count.d `pgrep -n postgres`
^C

Start                                          71
Commit                                         70
Total time (ns)                        2312105013</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   You should remember that trace programs need to be carefully written and
   debugged prior to their use, otherwise the trace information collected may
   be meaningless. In most cases where problems are found it is the 
   instrumentation that is at fault, not the underlying system. When 
   discussing information found using dynamic tracing, be sure to enclose
   the script used to allow that too to be checked and discussed.

<div class="sect2" title="25.4.4. Defining Trace Points">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="defining-trace-points">25.4.4. Defining Trace Points</h3></div></div></div>
<p>   New trace points can be defined within the code wherever the developer
   desires, though this will require a recompilation.
  </p>
<p>   A trace point can be inserted by using one of the
   trace macros. These are chosen according to how many variables will
   be made available for inspection at that trace point. Tracing the
   occurrence of an event can be achieved with a single line, using
   just the trace point name, e.g.
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">PG_TRACE (my__new__trace__point);</pre>
<p>
   More complex trace points can be provided with one or more variables
   for inspection by the dynamic tracing utility by using the
   <code class="literal">PG_TRACE</code><em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> macro that corresponds to the number
   of parameters after the trace point name:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">PG_TRACE3 (my__complex__event, varX, varY, varZ);</pre>
<p>
   The definition of the transaction__start trace point is shown below:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">static void
StartTransaction(void)
{
    ...

    /*
     * generate a new transaction id
     */
    s-&gt;transactionId = GetNewTransactionId(false);

    XactLockTableInsert(s-&gt;transactionId);

    PG_TRACE1(transaction__start, s-&gt;transactionId);

    ...
}    </pre>
<p>
   Note how the transaction ID is made available to the dynamic tracing
   utility.
  </p>
<p>   The dynamic tracing utility may require you to further define these trace
   points.  For example, DTrace requires you to add new probes to the file
   <code class="filename">src/backend/utils/probes.d</code> as shown here:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">provider postgresql {
      ...
      probe transaction__start(int);
      ...
 };</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   You should take care that the data types specified for the probe arguments
   match the datatypes of the variables used in the <code class="literal">PG_TRACE</code>
   macro. This is not checked at compile time. You can check that your newly
   added trace point is available by recompiling, then running the new binary,
   and as root, executing a DTrace command such as:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">dtrace -l -n transaction-start</pre>
<p>
  </p>
