<a name="id2604257"></a><p>   A <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> database cluster
   contains one or more named databases.  Users and groups of users are
   shared across the entire cluster, but no other data is shared across
   databases.  Any given client connection to the server can access
   only the data in a single database, the one specified in the connection
   request.
  </p>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>    Users of a cluster do not necessarily have the privilege to access every
    database in the cluster.  Sharing of user names means that there
    cannot be different users named, say, <code class="literal">joe</code> in two databases
    in the same cluster; but the system can be configured to allow
    <code class="literal">joe</code> access to only some of the databases.
   </p>
</div>
<p>   A database contains one or more named <em class="firstterm">schemas</em>, which
   in turn contain tables.  Schemas also contain other kinds of named
   objects, including data types, functions, and operators.  The same
   object name can be used in different schemas without conflict; for
   example, both <code class="literal">schema1</code> and <code class="literal">myschema</code> may
   contain tables named <code class="literal">mytable</code>.  Unlike databases,
   schemas are not rigidly separated: a user may access objects in any
   of the schemas in the database he is connected to, if he has
   privileges to do so.
  </p>
<p>   There are several reasons why one might want to use schemas:

   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>      To allow many users to use one database without interfering with
      each other.
     </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>      To organize database objects into logical groups to make them
      more manageable.
     </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>      Third-party applications can be put into separate schemas so
      they cannot collide with the names of other objects.
     </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>

   Schemas are analogous to directories at the operating system level,
   except that schemas cannot be nested.
  </p>
<div class="sect2" title="5.7.1. Creating a Schema">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ddl-schemas-create">5.7.1. Creating a Schema</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2604362"></a><p>    To create a schema, use the <a class="xref" href="sql-createschema.html" title="CREATE SCHEMA">CREATE SCHEMA</a> command.  Give the schema a name
    of your choice.  For example:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE SCHEMA myschema;</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<a name="id2604396"></a><a name="id2604402"></a><p>    To create or access objects in a schema, write a
    <em class="firstterm">qualified name</em> consisting of the schema name and
    table name separated by a dot:
</p>
<pre class="synopsis"><em class="replaceable"><code>schema</code></em><code class="literal">.</code><em class="replaceable"><code>table</code></em></pre>
<p>
    This works anywhere a table name is expected, including the table
    modification commands and the data access commands discussed in
    the following chapters.
    (For brevity we will speak of tables only, but the same ideas apply
    to other kinds of named objects, such as types and functions.)
   </p>
<p>    Actually, the even more general syntax
</p>
<pre class="synopsis"><em class="replaceable"><code>database</code></em><code class="literal">.</code><em class="replaceable"><code>schema</code></em><code class="literal">.</code><em class="replaceable"><code>table</code></em></pre>
<p>
    can be used too, but at present this is just for <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">pro
    forma</em></span> compliance with the SQL standard.  If you write a database name,
    it must be the same as the database you are connected to.
   </p>
<p>    So to create a table in the new schema, use
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE myschema.mytable (
 ...
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<a name="id2604477"></a><p>    To drop a schema if it's empty (all objects in it have been
    dropped), use
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">DROP SCHEMA myschema;</pre>
<p>
    To drop a schema including all contained objects, use
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">DROP SCHEMA myschema CASCADE;</pre>
<p>
    See <a class="xref" href="ddl-depend.html" title="5.11. Dependency Tracking">Section 5.11, &#8220;Dependency Tracking&#8221;</a> for a description of the general
    mechanism behind this.
   </p>
<p>    Often you will want to create a schema owned by someone else
    (since this is one of the ways to restrict the activities of your
    users to well-defined namespaces).  The syntax for that is:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE SCHEMA <em class="replaceable"><code>schemaname</code></em> AUTHORIZATION <em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em>;</pre>
<p>
    You can even omit the schema name, in which case the schema name
    will be the same as the user name.  See <a class="xref" href="ddl-schemas.html#ddl-schemas-patterns" title="5.7.6. Usage Patterns">Section 5.7.6, &#8220;Usage Patterns&#8221;</a> for how this can be useful.
   </p>
<p>    Schema names beginning with <code class="literal">pg_</code> are reserved for
    system purposes and may not be created by users.
   </p>

<a name="id2604555"></a><p>    In the previous sections we created tables without specifying any
    schema names.  By default, such tables (and other objects) are
    automatically put into a schema named <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">public</span>&#8221;</span>.  Every new
    database contains such a schema.  Thus, the following are equivalent:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products ( ... );</pre>
<p>
    and
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE public.products ( ... );</pre>
<p>
   </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" title="5.7.3. The Schema Search Path">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ddl-schemas-path">5.7.3. The Schema Search Path</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2604598"></a><a name="id2604604"></a><a name="id2604610"></a><p>    Qualified names are tedious to write, and it's often best not to
    wire a particular schema name into applications anyway.  Therefore
    tables are often referred to by <em class="firstterm">unqualified names</em>,
    which consist of just the table name.  The system determines which table
    is meant by following a <em class="firstterm">search path</em>, which is a list
    of schemas to look in.  The first matching table in the search path
    is taken to be the one wanted.  If there is no match in the search
    path, an error is reported, even if matching table names exist
    in other schemas in the database.
   </p>
<a name="id2604636"></a><p>    The first schema named in the search path is called the current schema.
    Aside from being the first schema searched, it is also the schema in
    which new tables will be created if the <code class="command">CREATE TABLE</code>
    command does not specify a schema name.
   </p>
<a name="id2604657"></a><p>    To show the current search path, use the following command:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SHOW search_path;</pre>
<p>
    In the default setup this returns:
</p>
<pre class="screen"> search_path
--------------
 "$user",public</pre>
<p>
    The first element specifies that a schema with the same name as
    the current user is to be searched.  If no such schema exists,
    the entry is ignored.  The second element refers to the
    public schema that we have seen already.
   </p>
<p>    The first schema in the search path that exists is the default
    location for creating new objects.  That is the reason that by
    default objects are created in the public schema.  When objects
    are referenced in any other context without schema qualification
    (table modification, data modification, or query commands) the
    search path is traversed until a matching object is found.
    Therefore, in the default configuration, any unqualified access
    again can only refer to the public schema.
   </p>
<p>    To put our new schema in the path, we use
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET search_path TO myschema,public;</pre>
<p>
    (We omit the <code class="literal">$user</code> here because we have no
    immediate need for it.)  And then we can access the table without
    schema qualification:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">DROP TABLE mytable;</pre>
<p>
    Also, since <code class="literal">myschema</code> is the first element in
    the path, new objects would by default be created in it.
   </p>
<p>    We could also have written
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET search_path TO myschema;</pre>
<p>
    Then we no longer have access to the public schema without
    explicit qualification.  There is nothing special about the public
    schema except that it exists by default.  It can be dropped, too.
   </p>
<p>    See also <a class="xref" href="functions-info.html" title="9.19. System Information Functions">Section 9.19, &#8220;System Information Functions&#8221;</a> for other ways to manipulate
    the schema search path.
   </p>
<p>    The search path works in the same way for data type names, function names,
    and operator names as it does for table names.  Data type and function
    names can be qualified in exactly the same way as table names.  If you
    need to write a qualified operator name in an expression, there is a
    special provision: you must write
</p>
<pre class="synopsis"><code class="literal">OPERATOR(</code><em class="replaceable"><code>schema</code></em><code class="literal">.</code><em class="replaceable"><code>operator</code></em><code class="literal">)</code></pre>
<p>
    This is needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity.  An example is
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT 3 OPERATOR(pg_catalog.+) 4;</pre>
<p>
    In practice one usually relies on the search path for operators,
    so as not to have to write anything so ugly as that.

<div class="sect2" title="5.7.4. Schemas and Privileges">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ddl-schemas-priv">5.7.4. Schemas and Privileges</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2604797"></a><p>    By default, users cannot access any objects in schemas they do not
    own.  To allow that, the owner of the schema needs to grant the
    <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privilege on the schema.  To allow users
    to make use of the objects in the schema, additional privileges
    may need to be granted, as appropriate for the object.
   </p>
<p>    A user can also be allowed to create objects in someone else's
    schema.  To allow that, the <code class="literal">CREATE</code> privilege on
    the schema needs to be granted.  Note that by default, everyone
    has <code class="literal">CREATE</code> and <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privileges on
    the schema
    <code class="literal">public</code>.  This allows all users that are able to
    connect to a given database to create objects in its
    <code class="literal">public</code> schema.  If you do
    not want to allow that, you can revoke that privilege:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;</pre>
<p>
    (The first <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">public</span>&#8221;</span> is the schema, the second
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">public</span>&#8221;</span> means <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">every user</span>&#8221;</span>.  In the
    first sense it is an identifier, in the second sense it is a
    key word, hence the different capitalization; recall the
    guidelines from <a class="xref" href="sql-syntax.html#sql-syntax-identifiers" title="4.1.1. Identifiers and Key Words">Section 4.1.1, &#8220;Identifiers and Key Words&#8221;</a>.)

<div class="sect2" title="5.7.5. The System Catalog Schema">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ddl-schemas-catalog">5.7.5. The System Catalog Schema</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2604898"></a><p>    In addition to <code class="literal">public</code> and user-created schemas, each
    database contains a <code class="literal">pg_catalog</code> schema, which contains
    the system tables and all the built-in data types, functions, and
    operators.  <code class="literal">pg_catalog</code> is always effectively part of
    the search path.  If it is not named explicitly in the path then
    it is implicitly searched <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> searching the path's
    schemas.  This ensures that built-in names will always be
    findable.  However, you may explicitly place
    <code class="literal">pg_catalog</code> at the end of your search path if you
    prefer to have user-defined names override built-in names.
   </p>
<p>    In <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> versions before 7.3,
    table names beginning with <code class="literal">pg_</code> were reserved.  This is
    no longer true: you may create such a table name if you wish, in
    any non-system schema.  However, it's best to continue to avoid
    such names, to ensure that you won't suffer a conflict if some
    future version defines a system table named the same as your
    table.  (With the default search path, an unqualified reference to
    your table name would be resolved as the system table instead.)
    System tables will continue to follow the convention of having
    names beginning with <code class="literal">pg_</code>, so that they will not
    conflict with unqualified user-table names so long as users avoid
    the <code class="literal">pg_</code> prefix.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" title="5.7.6. Usage Patterns">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ddl-schemas-patterns">5.7.6. Usage Patterns</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    Schemas can be used to organize your data in many ways.  There are
    a few usage patterns that are recommended and are easily supported by
    the default configuration:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>       If you do not create any schemas then all users access the
       public schema implicitly.  This simulates the situation where
       schemas are not available at all.  This setup is mainly
       recommended when there is only a single user or a few cooperating
       users in a database.  This setup also allows smooth transition
       from the non-schema-aware world.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>       You can create a schema for each user with the same name as
       that user.  Recall that the default search path starts with
       <code class="literal">$user</code>, which resolves to the user name.
       Therefore, if each user has a separate schema, they access their
       own schemas by default.
      </p>
<p>       If you use this setup then you might also want to revoke access
       to the public schema (or drop it altogether), so users are
       truly constrained to their own schemas.
      </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>       To install shared applications (tables to be used by everyone,
       additional functions provided by third parties, etc.), put them
       into separate schemas.  Remember to grant appropriate
       privileges to allow the other users to access them.  Users can
       then refer to these additional objects by qualifying the names
       with a schema name, or they can put the additional schemas into
       their search path, as they choose.
      </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
   </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" title="5.7.7. Portability">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ddl-schemas-portability">5.7.7. Portability</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    In the SQL standard, the notion of objects in the same schema
    being owned by different users does not exist.  Moreover, some
    implementations do not allow you to create schemas that have a
    different name than their owner.  In fact, the concepts of schema
    and user are nearly equivalent in a database system that
    implements only the basic schema support specified in the
    standard.  Therefore, many users consider qualified names to
    really consist of
    <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em>.<em class="replaceable"><code>tablename</code></em></code>.
    This is how <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> will effectively
    behave if you create a per-user schema for every user.
   </p>
<p>    Also, there is no concept of a <code class="literal">public</code> schema in the
    SQL standard.  For maximum conformance to the standard, you should
    not use (perhaps even remove) the <code class="literal">public</code> schema.
   </p>
<p>    Of course, some SQL database systems might not implement schemas
    at all, or provide namespace support by allowing (possibly
    limited) cross-database access.  If you need to work with those
    systems, then maximum portability would be achieved by not using
    schemas at all.
