<a name="id2684366"></a><p>   It is frequently convenient to group users together to ease
   management of privileges: that way, privileges can be granted to, or
   revoked from, a group as a whole.  In <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
   this is done by creating a role that represents the group, and then
   granting <em class="firstterm">membership</em> in the group role to individual user
   roles.
  </p>
<p>   To set up a group role, first create the role:
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">CREATE ROLE <em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em>;</pre>
<p>
   Typically a role being used as a group would not have the <code class="literal">LOGIN</code>
   attribute, though you can set it if you wish.
  </p>
<p>   Once the group role exists, you can add and remove members using the
   <a class="xref" href="sql-grant.html" title="GRANT">GRANT</a> and
   <a class="xref" href="sql-revoke.html" title="REVOKE">REVOKE</a> commands:
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">GRANT <em class="replaceable"><code>group_role</code></em> TO <em class="replaceable"><code>role1</code></em>, ... ;
REVOKE <em class="replaceable"><code>group_role</code></em> FROM <em class="replaceable"><code>role1</code></em>, ... ;</pre>
<p>
   You can grant membership to other group roles, too (since there isn't
   really any distinction between group roles and non-group roles).  The
   database will not let you set up circular membership loops.  Also,
   it is not permitted to grant membership in a role to
   <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>.
  </p>
<p>   The members of a role can use the privileges of the group role in two
   ways.  First, every member of a group can explicitly do
   <a class="xref" href="sql-set-role.html" title="SET ROLE">SET ROLE</a> to
   temporarily <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">become</span>&#8221;</span> the group role.  In this state, the
   database session has access to the privileges of the group role rather
   than the original login role, and any database objects created are
   considered owned by the group role not the login role.  Second, member
   roles that have the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> attribute automatically have use of
   privileges of roles they are members of.  As an example, suppose we have
   done
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE ROLE joe LOGIN INHERIT;
CREATE ROLE admin NOINHERIT;
CREATE ROLE wheel NOINHERIT;
GRANT admin TO joe;
GRANT wheel TO admin;</pre>
<p>
   Immediately after connecting as role <code class="literal">joe</code>, a database
   session will have use of privileges granted directly to <code class="literal">joe</code>
   plus any privileges granted to <code class="literal">admin</code>, because <code class="literal">joe</code>
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">inherits</span>&#8221;</span> <code class="literal">admin</code>'s privileges.  However, privileges
   granted to <code class="literal">wheel</code> are not available, because even though
   <code class="literal">joe</code> is indirectly a member of <code class="literal">wheel</code>, the
   membership is via <code class="literal">admin</code> which has the <code class="literal">NOINHERIT</code>
   attribute.  After
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET ROLE admin;</pre>
<p>
   the session would have use of only those privileges granted to
   <code class="literal">admin</code>, and not those granted to <code class="literal">joe</code>.  After
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET ROLE wheel;</pre>
<p>
   the session would have use of only those privileges granted to
   <code class="literal">wheel</code>, and not those granted to either <code class="literal">joe</code>
   or <code class="literal">admin</code>.  The original privilege state can be restored
   with any of
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET ROLE joe;
SET ROLE NONE;
RESET ROLE;</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>    The <code class="command">SET ROLE</code> command always allows selecting any role
    that the original login role is directly or indirectly a member of.
    Thus, in the above example, it is not necessary to become
    <code class="literal">admin</code> before becoming <code class="literal">wheel</code>.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>    In the SQL standard, there is a clear distinction between users and roles,
    and users do not automatically inherit privileges while roles do.  This
    behavior can be obtained in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> by giving
    roles being used as SQL roles the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> attribute, while
    giving roles being used as SQL users the <code class="literal">NOINHERIT</code> attribute.
    However, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> defaults to giving all roles
    the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> attribute, for backwards compatibility with pre-8.1
    releases in which users always had use of permissions granted to groups
    they were members of.
   </p>
</div>
<p>   The role attributes <code class="literal">LOGIN</code>, <code class="literal">SUPERUSER</code>,
   <code class="literal">CREATEDB</code>, and <code class="literal">CREATEROLE</code> can be thought of as
   special privileges, but they are never inherited as ordinary privileges
   on database objects are.  You must actually <code class="command">SET ROLE</code> to a
   specific role having one of these attributes in order to make use of
   the attribute.  Continuing the above example, we might well choose to
   grant <code class="literal">CREATEDB</code> and <code class="literal">CREATEROLE</code> to the
   <code class="literal">admin</code> role.  Then a session connecting as role <code class="literal">joe</code>
   would not have these privileges immediately, only after doing
   <code class="command">SET ROLE admin</code>.
  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>   To destroy a group role, use <a class="xref" href="sql-droprole.html" title="DROP ROLE">DROP ROLE</a>:
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">DROP ROLE <em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em>;</pre>
<p>
   Any memberships in the group role are automatically revoked (but the
   member roles are not otherwise affected).  Note however that any objects
   owned by the group role must first be dropped or reassigned to other
   owners; and any permissions granted to the group role must be revoked.
