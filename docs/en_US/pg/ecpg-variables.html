<p>   In <a class="xref" href="ecpg-commands.html" title="31.4. Running SQL Commands">Section 31.4, &#8220;Running SQL Commands&#8221;</a> you saw how you can execute SQL
   statements from an embedded SQL program.  Some of those statements
   only used fixed values and did not provide a way to insert
   user-supplied values into statements or have the program process
   the values returned by the query.  Those kinds of statements are
   not really useful in real applications.  This section explains in
   detail how you can pass data between your C program and the
   embedded SQL statements using a simple mechanism called
   <em class="firstterm">host variables</em>. In an embedded SQL program  we
   consider the SQL statements to be <em class="firstterm">guests</em> in the C
   program code which is the <em class="firstterm">host language</em>. Therefore
   the variables of the C program are called <em class="firstterm">host
   variables</em>.
  </p>
<div class="sect2" title="31.6.1. Overview">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2715890">31.6.1. Overview</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    Passing data between the C program and the SQL statements is
    particularly simple in embedded SQL.  Instead of having the
    program paste the data into the statement, which entails various
    complications, such as properly quoting the value, you can simply
    write the name of a C variable into the SQL statement, prefixed by
    a colon.  For example:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL INSERT INTO sometable VALUES (:v1, 'foo', :v2);</pre>
<p>
    This statements refers to two C variables named
    <code class="varname">v1</code> and <code class="varname">v2</code> and also uses a
    regular SQL string literal, to illustrate that you are not
    restricted to use one kind of data or the other.
   </p>
<p>    This style of inserting C variables in SQL statements works
    anywhere a value expression is expected in an SQL statement.
   </p>

<div class="sect2" title="31.6.2. Declare Sections">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2715924">31.6.2. Declare Sections</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    To pass data from the program to the database, for example as
    parameters in a query, or to pass data from the database back to
    the program, the C variables that are intended to contain this
    data need to be declared in specially marked sections, so the
    embedded SQL preprocessor is made aware of them.
   </p>
<p>    This section starts with
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;</pre>
<p>
    and ends with
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;</pre>
<p>
    Between those lines, there must be normal C variable declarations,
    such as
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">int   x = 4;
char  foo[16], bar[16];</pre>
<p>
    As you can see, you can optionally assign an initial value to the variable.
    The variable's scope is determined by the location of its declaring
    section within the program.
    You can also declare variables with the following syntax which implicitly
    creates a declare section:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL int i = 4;</pre>
<p>
    You can have as many declare sections in a program as you like.
   </p>
<p>    The declarations are also echoed to the output file as normal C
    variables, so there's no need to declare them again.  Variables
    that are not intended to be used in SQL commands can be declared
    normally outside these special sections.
   </p>
<p>    The definition of a structure or union also must be listed inside
    a <code class="literal">DECLARE</code> section. Otherwise the preprocessor cannot
    handle these types since it does not know the definition.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" title="31.6.3. Different types of host variables">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2715990">31.6.3. Different types of host variables</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    As a host variable you can also use arrays, typedefs, structs and
    pointers. Moreover there are special types of host variables that exist
    only in ECPG.
   </p>
<p>    A few examples on host variables:
    </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">Arrays</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>       One of the most common uses of an array declaration is probably the
       allocation of a char array as in
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    char str[50];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;</pre>
<p>
       Note that you have to take care of the length for yourself. If you use
       this host variable as the target variable of a query which returns a
       string with more than 49 characters, a buffer overflow occurs.
      </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Typedefs</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>      Use the <code class="literal">typedef</code> keyword to map new types to already
      existing types.
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    typedef char mychartype[40];
    typedef long serial_t;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;</pre>
<p>
       Note that you could also use
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL TYPE serial_t IS long;</pre>
<p>
       This declaration does not need to be part of a declare section.
      </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Pointers</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>       You can declare pointers to the most common types. Note however that
       you can not use pointers as target variables of queries without
       auto-allocation. See <a class="xref" href="ecpg-descriptors.html" title="31.10. Using SQL Descriptor Areas">Section 31.10, &#8220;Using SQL Descriptor Areas&#8221;</a> for more
       information on auto-allocation.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    int   *intp;
    char **charp;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;</pre>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Special types of variables</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>        ECPG contains some special types that help you to interact easily with
        data from the SQL server. For example it has implemented support for
        the <code class="type">varchar</code>, <code class="type">numeric</code>, <code class="type">date</code>, <code class="type">timestamp</code>, and <code class="type">interval</code> types.
        <a class="xref" href="ecpg-pgtypes.html" title="31.8. pgtypes library">Section 31.8, &#8220;pgtypes library&#8221;</a> contains basic functions to deal with
        those types, such that you do not need to send a query to the SQL
        server just for adding an interval to a timestamp for example.
       </p>
<p>        The special type <code class="type">VARCHAR</code> 
        is converted into a named <code class="type">struct</code> for every variable. A
        declaration like
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">VARCHAR var[180];</pre>
<p>
         is converted into
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">struct varchar_var { int len; char arr[180]; } var;</pre>
<p>
        This structure is suitable for interfacing with SQL datums of type
        <code class="type">varchar</code>.
       </p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<p>
   </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" title="31.6.4. SELECT INTO and FETCH INTO">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2716146">31.6.4. <code class="command">SELECT INTO</code> and <code class="command">FETCH INTO</code></h3></div></div></div>
<p>    Now you should be able to pass data generated by your program into
    an SQL command.  But how do you retrieve the results of a query?
    For that purpose, embedded SQL provides special variants of the
    usual commands <code class="command">SELECT</code> and
    <code class="command">FETCH</code>.  These commands have a special
    <code class="literal">INTO</code> clause that specifies which host variables
    the retrieved values are to be stored in.
   </p>
<p>    Here is an example:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">/*
 * assume this table:
 * CREATE TABLE test1 (a int, b varchar(50));
 */

EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int v1;
VARCHAR v2;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

 ...

EXEC SQL SELECT a, b INTO :v1, :v2 FROM test;</pre>
<p>
    So the <code class="literal">INTO</code> clause appears between the select
    list and the <code class="literal">FROM</code> clause.  The number of
    elements in the select list and the list after
    <code class="literal">INTO</code> (also called the target list) must be
    equal.
   </p>
<p>    Here is an example using the command <code class="command">FETCH</code>:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int v1;
VARCHAR v2;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

 ...

EXEC SQL DECLARE foo CURSOR FOR SELECT a, b FROM test;

 ...

do {
    ...
    EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM foo INTO :v1, :v2;
    ...
} while (...);</pre>
<p>
    Here the <code class="literal">INTO</code> clause appears after all the
    normal clauses.
   </p>
<p>    Both of these methods only allow retrieving one row at a time.  If
    you need to process result sets that potentially contain more than
    one row, you need to use a cursor, as shown in the second example.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" title="31.6.5. Indicators">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2716249">31.6.5. Indicators</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    The examples above do not handle null values.  In fact, the
    retrieval examples will raise an error if they fetch a null value
    from the database.  To be able to pass null values to the database
    or retrieve null values from the database, you need to append a
    second host variable specification to each host variable that
    contains data.  This second host variable is called the
    <em class="firstterm">indicator</em> and contains a flag that tells
    whether the datum is null, in which case the value of the real
    host variable is ignored.  Here is an example that handles the
    retrieval of null values correctly:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
VARCHAR val;
int val_ind;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION:

 ...

EXEC SQL SELECT b INTO :val :val_ind FROM test1;</pre>
<p>
    The indicator variable <code class="varname">val_ind</code> will be zero if
    the value was not null, and it will be negative if the value was
    null.
   </p>
<p>    The indicator has another function: if the indicator value is
    positive, it means that the value is not null, but it was
    truncated when it was stored in the host variable.
   </p>
