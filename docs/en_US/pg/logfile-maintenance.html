<a name="id2693652"></a><p>   It is a good idea to save the database server's log output
   somewhere, rather than just routing it to <code class="filename">/dev/null</code>.
   The log output is invaluable when it comes time to diagnose
   problems.  However, the log output tends to be voluminous
   (especially at higher debug levels) and you won't want to save it
   indefinitely.  You need to <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">rotate</span>&#8221;</span> the log files so that
   new log files are started and old ones removed after a reasonable
   period of time.
  </p>
<p>   If you simply direct the <span class="systemitem">stderr</span> of
   <code class="command">postgres</code> into a
   file, you will have log output, but
   the only way to truncate the log file is to stop and restart
   the server. This may be OK if you are using
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> in a development environment,
   but few production servers would find this behavior acceptable.
  </p>
<p>   A better approach is to send the server's
   <span class="systemitem">stderr</span> output to some type of log rotation program.
   There is a built-in log rotation program, which you can use by
   setting the configuration parameter <code class="literal">redirect_stderr</code> to
   <code class="literal">true</code> in <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>.  The control
   parameters for this program are described in <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-logging.html#runtime-config-logging-where" title="17.7.1. Where To Log">Section 17.7.1, &#8220;Where To Log&#8221;</a>.
  </p>
<p>   Alternatively, you might prefer to use an external log rotation
   program, if you have one that you are already using with other
   server software. For example, the <span class="application">rotatelogs</span>
   tool included in the <span class="productname">Apache</span> distribution
   can be used with <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.  To do this,
   just pipe the server's
   <span class="systemitem">stderr</span> output to the desired program.
   If you start the server with
   <code class="command">pg_ctl</code>, then <span class="systemitem">stderr</span>
   is already redirected to <span class="systemitem">stdout</span>, so you just need a
   pipe command, for example:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">pg_ctl start | rotatelogs /var/log/pgsql_log 86400</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Another production-grade approach to managing log output is to
   send it all to <span class="application">syslog</span> and let
   <span class="application">syslog</span> deal with file rotation. To do this, set the
   configuration parameter <code class="literal">log_destination</code> to <code class="literal">syslog</code>
   (to log to <span class="application">syslog</span> only) in
   <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>. Then you can send a <code class="literal">SIGHUP</code>
   signal to the <span class="application">syslog</span> daemon whenever you want to force it
   to start writing a new log file.  If you want to automate log
   rotation, the <span class="application">logrotate</span> program can be
   configured to work with log files from
   <span class="application">syslog</span>.
  </p>
<p>   On many systems, however, <span class="application">syslog</span> is not very reliable,
   particularly with large log messages; it may truncate or drop messages
   just when you need them the most.  Also, on <span class="productname">Linux</span>,
   <span class="application">syslog</span> will sync each message to disk, yielding poor
   performance.  (You can use a <code class="literal">-</code> at the start of the file name
   in the <span class="application">syslog</span> configuration file to disable this behavior.)
  </p>
<p>   Note that all the solutions described above take care of starting new
   log files at configurable intervals, but they do not handle deletion
   of old, no-longer-interesting log files.  You will probably want to set
   up a batch job to periodically delete old log files.  Another possibility
   is to configure the rotation program so that old log files are overwritten
   cyclically.
