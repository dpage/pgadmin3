<a name="id2748594"></a><p>     This chapter discusses the rule system in
     <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.  Production rule systems
     are conceptually simple, but there are many subtle points
     involved in actually using them.</p>
<p>     Some other database systems define active database rules, which
     are usually stored procedures and triggers.  In
     <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, these can be implemented
     using functions and triggers as well.</p>
<p>     The rule system (more precisely speaking, the query rewrite rule
     system) is totally different from stored procedures and triggers.
     It modifies queries to take rules into consideration, and then
     passes the modified query to the query planner for planning and
     execution.  It is very powerful, and can be used for many things
     such as query language procedures, views, and versions.  The
     theoretical foundations and the power of this rule system are
     also discussed in <a class="xref" href="biblio.html#ston90b">[ston90b]</a> and <a class="xref" href="biblio.html#ong90">[ong90]</a>.</p>

<a name="id2748656"></a><p>    To understand how the rule system works it is necessary to know
    when it is invoked and what its input and results are.</p>
<p>    The rule system is located between the parser and the planner.
    It takes the output of the parser, one query tree, and the user-defined
    rewrite rules, which are also
    query trees with some extra information, and creates zero or more
    query trees as result. So its input and output are always things
    the parser itself could have produced and thus, anything it sees
    is basically representable as an <acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym> statement.</p>
<p>    Now what is a query tree? It is an internal representation of an
    <acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym> statement where the single parts that it is
    built from are stored separately. These query trees can be shown
    in the server log if you set the configuration parameters
    <code class="varname">debug_print_parse</code>,
    <code class="varname">debug_print_rewritten</code>, or
    <code class="varname">debug_print_plan</code>.  The rule actions are also
    stored as query trees, in the system catalog
    <code class="structname">pg_rewrite</code>.  They are not formatted like
    the log output, but they contain exactly the same information.</p>
<p>    Reading a raw query tree requires some experience.  But since
    <acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym> representations of query trees are
    sufficient to understand the rule system, this chapter will not
    teach how to read them.</p>
<p>    When reading the <acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym> representations of the 
    query trees in this chapter it is necessary to be able to identify
    the parts the statement is broken into when it is in the query tree
    structure. The parts of a query tree are

</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">        the command type
    </span></dt>
<dd><p>        This is a simple value telling which command
        (<code class="command">SELECT</code>, <code class="command">INSERT</code>,
        <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, <code class="command">DELETE</code>) produced
        the query tree.
    </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">        the range table
    </span></dt>
<dd>
<p>        The range table is a list of relations that are used in the query.
        In a <code class="command">SELECT</code> statement these are the relations given after
        the <code class="literal">FROM</code> key word.
    </p>
<p>        Every range table entry identifies a table or view and tells
        by which name it is called in the other parts of the query.
        In the query tree, the range table entries are referenced by
        number rather than by name, so here it doesn't matter if there
        are duplicate names as it would in an <acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym>
        statement. This can happen after the range tables of rules
        have been merged in. The examples in this chapter will not have
        this situation.
    </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">        the result relation
    </span></dt>
<dd>
<p>        This is an index into the range table that identifies the
        relation where the results of the query go.
    </p>
<p>        <code class="command">SELECT</code> queries normally don't have a result
        relation. The special case of a <code class="command">SELECT INTO</code> is
        mostly identical to a <code class="command">CREATE TABLE</code> followed by a
        <code class="literal">INSERT ... SELECT</code> and is not discussed
        separately here.
    </p>
<p>        For <code class="command">INSERT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, and
        <code class="command">DELETE</code> commands, the result relation is the table
        (or view!) where the changes are to take effect.
    </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">        the target list
    </span></dt>
<dd>
<p>        The target list is a list of expressions that define the
        result of the query.  In the case of a
        <code class="command">SELECT</code>, these expressions are the ones that
        build the final output of the query.  They correspond to the
        expressions between the key words <code class="command">SELECT</code>
        and <code class="command">FROM</code>.  (<code class="literal">*</code> is just an
        abbreviation for all the column names of a relation.  It is
        expanded by the parser into the individual columns, so the
        rule system never sees it.)
    </p>
<p>        <code class="command">DELETE</code> commands don't need a target list
        because they don't produce any result. In fact, the planner will
        add a special <acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym> entry to the empty target list, but
        this is after the rule system and will be discussed later; for the
        rule system, the target list is empty.
    </p>
<p>        For <code class="command">INSERT</code> commands, the target list describes
        the new rows that should go into the result relation. It consists of the
        expressions in the <code class="literal">VALUES</code> clause or the ones from the
        <code class="command">SELECT</code> clause in <code class="literal">INSERT
        ... SELECT</code>.  The first step of the rewrite process adds
        target list entries for any columns that were not assigned to by
        the original command but have defaults.  Any remaining columns (with
        neither a given value nor a default) will be filled in by the
        planner with a constant null expression.
    </p>
<p>        For <code class="command">UPDATE</code> commands, the target list
        describes the new rows that should replace the old ones. In the
        rule system, it contains just the expressions from the <code class="literal">SET
        column = expression</code> part of the command.  The planner will handle
        missing columns by inserting expressions that copy the values from
        the old row into the new one. And it will add the special
        <acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym> entry just as for <code class="command">DELETE</code>, too.
    </p>
<p>        Every entry in the target list contains an expression that can
        be a constant value, a variable pointing to a column of one
        of the relations in the range table, a parameter, or an expression
        tree made of function calls, constants, variables, operators, etc.
    </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">        the qualification
    </span></dt>
<dd><p>        The query's qualification is an expression much like one of
        those contained in the target list entries. The result value of
        this expression is a Boolean that tells whether the operation
        (<code class="command">INSERT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code>,
        <code class="command">DELETE</code>, or <code class="command">SELECT</code>) for the
        final result row should be executed or not. It corresponds to the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause
        of an <acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym> statement.
    </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">        the join tree
    </span></dt>
<dd><p>        The query's join tree shows the structure of the <code class="literal">FROM</code> clause.
        For a simple query like <code class="literal">SELECT ... FROM a, b, c</code>, the join tree is just
        a list of the <code class="literal">FROM</code> items, because we are allowed to join them in
        any order.  But when <code class="literal">JOIN</code> expressions, particularly outer joins,
        are used, we have to join in the order shown by the joins.
        In that case, the join tree shows the structure of the <code class="literal">JOIN</code> expressions.  The
        restrictions associated with particular <code class="literal">JOIN</code> clauses (from <code class="literal">ON</code> or
        <code class="literal">USING</code> expressions) are stored as qualification expressions attached
        to those join-tree nodes.  It turns out to be convenient to store
        the top-level <code class="literal">WHERE</code> expression as a qualification attached to the
        top-level join-tree item, too.  So really the join tree represents
        both the <code class="literal">FROM</code> and <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clauses of a <code class="command">SELECT</code>.
    </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">        the others
    </span></dt>
<dd><p>        The other parts of the query tree like the <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code>
        clause aren't of interest here. The rule system
        substitutes some entries there while applying rules, but that
        doesn't have much to do with the fundamentals of the rule
        system.
