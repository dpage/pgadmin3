<p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> enforces SQL uniqueness constraints
   using <em class="firstterm">unique indexes</em>, which are indexes that disallow
   multiple entries with identical keys.  An access method that supports this
   feature sets <code class="structname">pg_am</code>.<code class="structfield">amcanunique</code> true.
   (At present, only b-tree supports it.)
  </p>
<p>   Because of MVCC, it is always necessary to allow duplicate entries to
   exist physically in an index: the entries might refer to successive
   versions of a single logical row.  The behavior we actually want to
   enforce is that no MVCC snapshot could include two rows with equal
   index keys.  This breaks down into the following cases that must be
   checked when inserting a new row into a unique index:

    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>       If a conflicting valid row has been deleted by the current transaction,
       it's okay.  (In particular, since an UPDATE always deletes the old row
       version before inserting the new version, this will allow an UPDATE on
       a row without changing the key.)
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>       If a conflicting row has been inserted by an as-yet-uncommitted
       transaction, the would-be inserter must wait to see if that transaction
       commits.  If it rolls back then there is no conflict.  If it commits
       without deleting the conflicting row again, there is a uniqueness
       violation.  (In practice we just wait for the other transaction to
       end and then redo the visibility check in toto.)
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>       Similarly, if a conflicting valid row has been deleted by an
       as-yet-uncommitted transaction, the would-be inserter must wait
       for that transaction to commit or abort, and then repeat the test.
      </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Furthermore, immediately before raising a uniqueness violation
   according to the above rules, the access method must recheck the
   liveness of the row being inserted.  If it is committed dead then
   no error should be raised.  (This case cannot occur during the
   ordinary scenario of inserting a row that's just been created by
   the current transaction.  It can happen during
   <code class="command">CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>, however.) 
  </p>
<p>   We require the index access method to apply these tests itself, which
   means that it must reach into the heap to check the commit status of
   any row that is shown to have a duplicate key according to the index
   contents.  This is without a doubt ugly and non-modular, but it saves
   redundant work: if we did a separate probe then the index lookup for
   a conflicting row would be essentially repeated while finding the place to
   insert the new row's index entry.  What's more, there is no obvious way
   to avoid race conditions unless the conflict check is an integral part
   of insertion of the new index entry.
  </p>
<p>   The main limitation of this scheme is that it has no convenient way
   to support deferred uniqueness checks.
