<div class="refsect1" title="Description">
<a name="id2822262"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>   <code class="command">VACUUM</code> reclaims storage occupied by deleted tuples.
   In normal <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> operation, tuples that
   are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from
   their table; they remain present until a <code class="command">VACUUM</code> is
   done.  Therefore it's necessary to do <code class="command">VACUUM</code>
   periodically, especially on frequently-updated tables.
  </p>
<p>   With no parameter, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> processes every table in the
   current database.  With a parameter, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> processes
   only that table.
  </p>
<p>   <code class="command">VACUUM ANALYZE</code> performs a <code class="command">VACUUM</code>
   and then an <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> for each selected table.  This
   is a handy combination form for routine maintenance scripts.  See
   <a class="xref" href="sql-analyze.html" title="ANALYZE">ANALYZE</a>
   for more details about its processing.
  </p>
<p>   Plain <code class="command">VACUUM</code> (without <code class="literal">FULL</code>) simply reclaims
   space and makes it
   available for re-use.  This form of the command can operate in parallel
   with normal reading and writing of the table, as an exclusive lock
   is not obtained. <code class="command">VACUUM
   FULL</code> does more extensive processing, including moving of tuples
   across blocks to try to compact the table to the minimum number of disk
   blocks.  This form is much slower and requires an exclusive lock on each
   table while it is being processed.
  </p>

<a name="id2822372"></a><h2>Parameters</h2>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">FULL</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>      Selects <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">full</span>&#8221;</span> vacuum, which may reclaim more
      space, but takes much longer and exclusively locks the table.

<dd><p>      Selects aggressive <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">freezing</span>&#8221;</span> of tuples.
      Specifying <code class="literal">FREEZE</code> is equivalent to performing
      <code class="command">VACUUM</code> with the
      <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#guc-vacuum-freeze-min-age">vacuum_freeze_min_age</a> parameter
      set to zero.  The <code class="literal">FREEZE</code> option is deprecated and
      will be removed in a future release; set the parameter instead.
     </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">VERBOSE</code></span></dt>

      efficient way to execute a query.
     </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>table</code></em></span></dt>
<dd><p>      The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a specific table to
      vacuum. Defaults to all tables in the current database.
     </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>column</code></em></span></dt>
<dd><p>      The name of a specific column to analyze. Defaults to all columns.

<div class="refsect1" title="Outputs">
<a name="id2822481"></a><h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>    When <code class="literal">VERBOSE</code> is specified, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> emits
    progress messages to indicate which table is currently being
    processed.  Various statistics about the tables are printed as well.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" title="Notes">
<a name="id2822501"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>    <code class="command">VACUUM</code> cannot be executed inside a transaction block.
   </p>
<p>    We recommend that active production databases be
    vacuumed frequently (at least nightly), in order to
    remove expired rows. After adding or deleting a large number
    of rows, it may be a good idea to issue a <code class="command">VACUUM
    ANALYZE</code> command for the affected table. This will update the
    system catalogs with
    the results of all recent changes, and allow the
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> query planner to make better
    choices in planning queries.
   </p>
<p>    The <code class="option">FULL</code> option is not recommended for routine use,
    but may be useful in special cases.  An example is when you have deleted
    most of the rows in a table and would like the table to physically shrink
    to occupy less disk space.  <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> will usually
    shrink the table more than a plain <code class="command">VACUUM</code> would.
    The <code class="option">FULL</code> option does not shrink indexes; a periodic
    <code class="command">REINDEX</code> is still recommended.  In fact, it is often faster
    to drop all indexes, <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code>, and recreate the indexes.
   </p>
<p>    <code class="command">VACUUM</code> causes a substantial increase in I/O traffic,
    which can cause poor performance for other active sessions.  Therefore,
    it is sometimes advisable to use the cost-based vacuum delay feature.
    See <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-resource.html#runtime-config-resource-vacuum-cost" title="17.4.4.  Cost-Based Vacuum Delay">Section 17.4.4, &#8220;       Cost-Based Vacuum Delay
     &#8221;</a> for details.
   </p>
<p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> includes an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">autovacuum</span>&#8221;</span>
    facility which can automate routine vacuum maintenance.  For more
    information about automatic and manual vacuuming, see
    <a class="xref" href="maintenance.html#routine-vacuuming" title="22.1. Routine Vacuuming">Section 22.1, &#8220;Routine Vacuuming&#8221;</a>.
