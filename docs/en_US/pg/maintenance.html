<a name="id2692007"></a><a name="id2692016"></a><p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, like any database software, requires that certain tasks
   be performed regularly to achieve optimum performance. The tasks
   discussed here are <span class="emphasis"><em>required</em></span>, but they
   are repetitive in nature and can easily be automated using standard
   Unix tools such as <span class="application">cron</span> scripts or
   Windows' <span class="application">Task Scheduler</span>.  But it is the database
   administrator's responsibility to set up appropriate scripts, and to
   check that they execute successfully.
  </p>
<p>   One obvious maintenance task is creation of backup copies of the data on a
   regular schedule.  Without a recent backup, you have no chance of recovery
   after a catastrophe (disk failure, fire, mistakenly dropping a critical
   table, etc.).  The backup and recovery mechanisms available in
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> are discussed at length in
   <a class="xref" href="backup.html" title="Chapter 23. Backup and Restore">Chapter 23, <i>Backup and Restore</i></a>.
  </p>
<p>   The other main category of maintenance task is periodic <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vacuuming</span>&#8221;</span>
   of the database.  This activity is discussed in
   <a class="xref" href="maintenance.html#routine-vacuuming" title="22.1. Routine Vacuuming">Section 22.1, &#8220;Routine Vacuuming&#8221;</a>.  Closely related to this is updating
   the statistics that will be used by the query planner, as discussed in
   <a class="xref" href="maintenance.html#vacuum-for-statistics" title="22.1.2. Updating planner statistics">Section 22.1.2, &#8220;Updating planner statistics&#8221;</a>.
  </p>
<p>   Another task that might need periodic attention is log file management.
   This is discussed in <a class="xref" href="logfile-maintenance.html" title="22.3. Log File Maintenance">Section 22.3, &#8220;Log File Maintenance&#8221;</a>.
  </p>
<p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> is low-maintenance compared
   to some other database management systems.  Nonetheless,
   appropriate attention to these tasks will go far towards ensuring a
   pleasant and productive experience with the system.

<a name="id2692129"></a><p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>'s <code class="command">VACUUM</code> command
   <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be run on a regular basis for several reasons:

    </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">To recover or reuse disk space occupied by updated or deleted
      rows.</li>
<li class="listitem">To update data statistics used by the
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> query planner.</li>
<li class="listitem">To protect against loss of very old data due to
      <em class="firstterm">transaction ID wraparound</em>.</li>
</ol></div>
<p>

   The frequency and scope of the <code class="command">VACUUM</code> operations
   performed for each of these reasons will vary depending on the
   needs of each site.  Therefore, database administrators must
   understand these issues and develop an appropriate maintenance
   strategy.  This section concentrates on explaining the high-level
   issues; for details about command syntax and so on, see the <a class="xref" href="sql-vacuum.html" title="VACUUM">VACUUM</a> reference page.
  </p>
<p>   The standard form of <code class="command">VACUUM</code> can run in parallel with production
   database operations. Commands such as <code class="command">SELECT</code>,
   <code class="command">INSERT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, and <code class="command">DELETE</code>
   will continue to function as normal, though you will not be able to modify the
   definition of a table with commands such as <code class="command">ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN</code>
   while it is being vacuumed.
   Also, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> requires a substantial amount of I/O
   traffic, which can cause poor performance for other active sessions.
   There are configuration parameters that can be adjusted to reduce the
   performance impact of background vacuuming &#8212; see
   <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-resource.html#runtime-config-resource-vacuum-cost" title="17.4.4.  Cost-Based Vacuum Delay">Section 17.4.4, &#8220;       Cost-Based Vacuum Delay
     &#8221;</a>.
  </p>
<p>   An automated mechanism for performing the necessary <code class="command">VACUUM</code>
   operations has been added in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.1.
   See <a class="xref" href="maintenance.html#autovacuum" title="22.1.4. The auto-vacuum daemon">Section 22.1.4, &#8220;The auto-vacuum daemon&#8221;</a>.
  </p>
<div class="sect2" title="22.1.1. Recovering disk space">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="vacuum-for-space-recovery">22.1.1. Recovering disk space</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2692298"></a><p>    In normal <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> operation, an
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code> or <code class="command">DELETE</code> of a row does not
    immediately remove the old version of the row.
    This approach is necessary to gain the benefits of multiversion
    concurrency control (see <a class="xref" href="mvcc.html" title="Chapter 12. Concurrency Control">Chapter 12, <i>Concurrency Control</i></a>): the row version
    must not be deleted while it is still potentially visible to other
    transactions. But eventually, an outdated or deleted row version is no
    longer of interest to any transaction. The space it occupies must be
    reclaimed for reuse by new rows, to avoid infinite growth of disk
    space requirements. This is done by running <code class="command">VACUUM</code>.
   </p>
<p>    Clearly, a table that receives frequent updates or deletes will need
    to be vacuumed more often than tables that are seldom updated. It
    may be useful to set up periodic <span class="application">cron</span> tasks that
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code> only selected tables, skipping tables that are known not to
    change often. This is only likely to be helpful if you have both
    large heavily-updated tables and large seldom-updated tables &#8212; the
    extra cost of vacuuming a small table isn't enough to be worth
    worrying about.
   </p>
<p>    There are two variants of the <code class="command">VACUUM</code>
    command. The first form, known as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">lazy vacuum</span>&#8221;</span> or
    just <code class="command">VACUUM</code>, marks expired data in tables and
    indexes for future reuse; it does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> attempt
    to reclaim the space used by this expired data unless the space is
    at the end of the table and an exclusive table lock can be easily 
    obtained. Unused space at the start or middle of the file does
    not result in the file being shortened and space returned to the
    operating system. This variant of <code class="command">VACUUM</code> can be
    run concurrently with normal database operations.
   </p>
<p>    The second form is the <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code>
    command. This uses a more aggressive algorithm for reclaiming the
    space consumed by expired row versions. Any space that is freed by
    <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> is immediately returned to the
    operating system. Unfortunately, this variant of the
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code> command acquires an exclusive lock on
    each table while <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> is processing
    it. Therefore, frequently using <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> can
    have an extremely negative effect on the performance of concurrent
    database queries.
   </p>
<p>    The standard form of <code class="command">VACUUM</code> is best used with the goal
    of maintaining a fairly level steady-state usage of disk space. If
    you need to return disk space to the operating system you can use
    <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> &#8212; but what's the point of releasing disk
    space that will only have to be allocated again soon?  Moderately
    frequent standard <code class="command">VACUUM</code> runs are a better approach
    than infrequent <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> runs for maintaining
    heavily-updated tables.
   </p>
<p>    Recommended practice for most sites is to schedule a database-wide
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code> once a day at a low-usage time of day,
    supplemented by more frequent vacuuming of heavily-updated tables
    if necessary. (Some installations with extremely high update rates
    vacuum their busiest tables as often as once every few minutes.)
    If you have multiple databases
    in a cluster, don't forget to <code class="command">VACUUM</code> each one;
    the program <a class="xref" href="app-vacuumdb.html" title="vacuumdb"><span class="application">vacuumdb</span></a>
    may be helpful.
   </p>
<p>    <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> is recommended for cases where you know
    you have deleted the majority of rows in a table, so that the
    steady-state size of the table can be shrunk substantially with
    <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code>'s more aggressive approach.  Use plain
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code>, not <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code>, for routine
    vacuuming for space recovery.
   </p>
<p>    If you have a table whose entire contents are deleted on a periodic
    basis, consider doing it with <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> rather
    than using <code class="command">DELETE</code> followed by
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code>. <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> removes the
    entire content of the table immediately, without requiring a
    subsequent <code class="command">VACUUM</code> or <code class="command">VACUUM
    FULL</code> to reclaim the now-unused disk space.

<div class="sect2" title="22.1.2. Updating planner statistics">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="vacuum-for-statistics">22.1.2. Updating planner statistics</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2692593"></a><a name="id2692606"></a><p>    The <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> query planner relies on
    statistical information about the contents of tables in order to
    generate good plans for queries.  These statistics are gathered by
    the <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> command, which can be invoked by itself or
    as an optional step in <code class="command">VACUUM</code>.  It is important to have
    reasonably accurate statistics, otherwise poor choices of plans may
    degrade database performance.
   </p>
<p>    As with vacuuming for space recovery, frequent updates of statistics
    are more useful for heavily-updated tables than for seldom-updated
    ones. But even for a heavily-updated table, there may be no need for
    statistics updates if the statistical distribution of the data is
    not changing much. A simple rule of thumb is to think about how much
    the minimum and maximum values of the columns in the table change.
    For example, a <code class="type">timestamp</code> column that contains the time
    of row update will have a constantly-increasing maximum value as
    rows are added and updated; such a column will probably need more
    frequent statistics updates than, say, a column containing URLs for
    pages accessed on a website. The URL column may receive changes just
    as often, but the statistical distribution of its values probably
    changes relatively slowly.
   </p>
<p>    It is possible to run <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> on specific tables and even
    just specific columns of a table, so the flexibility exists to update some
    statistics more frequently than others if your application requires it.
    In practice, however, it is usually best to just analyze the entire database
    because it is a fast operation.  It uses a statistical random sampling of 
    the rows of a table rather than reading every single row.
   </p>
<div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
<p>     Although per-column tweaking of <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> frequency may not be
     very productive, you may well find it worthwhile to do per-column
     adjustment of the level of detail of the statistics collected by
     <code class="command">ANALYZE</code>.  Columns that are heavily used in <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clauses
     and have highly irregular data distributions may require a finer-grain
     data histogram than other columns.  See <code class="command">ALTER TABLE SET
     STATISTICS</code>.
    </p>
</div>
<p>    Recommended practice for most sites is to schedule a database-wide
    <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> once a day at a low-usage time of day; this can
    usefully be combined with a nightly <code class="command">VACUUM</code>.  However,
    sites with relatively slowly changing table statistics may find that
    this is overkill, and that less-frequent <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> runs
    are sufficient.

<div class="sect2" title="22.1.3. Preventing transaction ID wraparound failures">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="vacuum-for-wraparound">22.1.3. Preventing transaction ID wraparound failures</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2692744"></a><p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>'s MVCC transaction semantics
    depend on being able to compare transaction ID (<acronym class="acronym">XID</acronym>)
    numbers: a row version with an insertion XID greater than the current
    transaction's XID is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">in the future</span>&#8221;</span> and should not be visible
    to the current transaction.  But since transaction IDs have limited size
    (32 bits at this writing) a cluster that runs for a long time (more
    than 4 billion transactions) would suffer <em class="firstterm">transaction ID
    wraparound</em>: the XID counter wraps around to zero, and all of a sudden
    transactions that were in the past appear to be in the future &#8212; which
    means their outputs become invisible.  In short, catastrophic data loss.
    (Actually the data is still there, but that's cold comfort if you can't
    get at it.)  To avoid this, it is necessary to vacuum every table
    in every database at least once every two billion transactions.
   </p>
<p>    The reason that periodic vacuuming solves the problem is that
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> distinguishes a special XID
    <code class="literal">FrozenXID</code>.  This XID is always considered older
    than every normal XID. Normal XIDs are
    compared using modulo-2<sup>31</sup> arithmetic. This means
    that for every normal XID, there are two billion XIDs that are
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">older</span>&#8221;</span> and two billion that are <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">newer</span>&#8221;</span>; another
    way to say it is that the normal XID space is circular with no
    endpoint. Therefore, once a row version has been created with a particular
    normal XID, the row version will appear to be <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">in the past</span>&#8221;</span> for
    the next two billion transactions, no matter which normal XID we are
    talking about. If the row version still exists after more than two billion
    transactions, it will suddenly appear to be in the future. To
    prevent data loss, old row versions must be reassigned the XID
    <code class="literal">FrozenXID</code> sometime before they reach the
    two-billion-transactions-old mark. Once they are assigned this
    special XID, they will appear to be <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">in the past</span>&#8221;</span> to all
    normal transactions regardless of wraparound issues, and so such
    row versions will be good until deleted, no matter how long that is.
    This reassignment of old XIDs is handled by <code class="command">VACUUM</code>.
   </p>
<p>    <code class="command">VACUUM</code>'s behavior is controlled by the configuration parameter
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#guc-vacuum-freeze-min-age">vacuum_freeze_min_age</a>: any XID older than
    <code class="varname">vacuum_freeze_min_age</code> transactions is replaced by
    <code class="literal">FrozenXID</code>.  Larger values of <code class="varname">vacuum_freeze_min_age</code>
    preserve transactional information longer, while smaller values increase
    the number of transactions that can elapse before the table must be
    vacuumed again.
   </p>
<p>    The maximum time that a table can go unvacuumed is two billion
    transactions minus the <code class="varname">vacuum_freeze_min_age</code> that was used
    when it was last vacuumed.
    If it were to go unvacuumed for longer than that,
    data loss could result.  To ensure that this does not
    happen, the <em class="firstterm">autovacuum</em> facility described in
    <a class="xref" href="maintenance.html#autovacuum" title="22.1.4. The auto-vacuum daemon">Section 22.1.4, &#8220;The auto-vacuum daemon&#8221;</a> is invoked on any table
    that might contain XIDs older than the age specified by the
    configuration parameter
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#guc-autovacuum-freeze-max-age">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</a>.  (This will happen
    even if autovacuum is otherwise disabled.)
   </p>
<p>    This implies that if a table is not otherwise vacuumed,
    autovacuum will be invoked on it approximately once every
    <code class="varname">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code> minus
    <code class="varname">vacuum_freeze_min_age</code> transactions.
    For tables that are regularly vacuumed for space reclamation purposes,
    this is of little importance.  However, for static tables
    (including tables that receive inserts, but no updates or deletes),
    there is no need for vacuuming for space reclamation, and so it can
    be useful to try to maximize the interval between forced autovacuums
    on very large static tables.  Obviously one can do this either by
    increasing <code class="varname">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code> or by decreasing
    <code class="varname">vacuum_freeze_min_age</code>.
   </p>
<p>    The sole disadvantage of increasing <code class="varname">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code>
    is that the <code class="filename">pg_clog</code> subdirectory of the database cluster
    will take more space, because it must store the commit status for all
    transactions back to the <code class="varname">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code> horizon.
    The commit status uses two bits per transaction, so if
    <code class="varname">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code> has its maximum allowed value of
    a little less than two billion, <code class="filename">pg_clog</code> can be expected to
    grow to about half a gigabyte.  If this is trivial compared to your
    total database size, setting <code class="varname">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code> to
    its maximum allowed value is recommended.  Otherwise, set it depending
    on what you are willing to allow for <code class="filename">pg_clog</code> storage.
    (The default, 200 million transactions, translates to about 50MB of
    <code class="filename">pg_clog</code> storage.)
   </p>
<p>    One disadvantage of decreasing <code class="varname">vacuum_freeze_min_age</code> is that
    it may cause <code class="command">VACUUM</code> to do useless work: changing a table row's
    XID to <code class="literal">FrozenXID</code> is a waste of time if the row is modified
    soon thereafter (causing it to acquire a new XID).  So the setting should
    be large enough that rows are not frozen until they are unlikely to change
    any more.  Another disadvantage of decreasing this setting is
    that details about exactly which transaction inserted or modified a
    row will be lost sooner.  This information sometimes comes in handy,
    particularly when trying to analyze what went wrong after a database
    failure.  For these two reasons, decreasing this setting is not
    recommended except for completely static tables.
   </p>
<p>    To track the age of the oldest XIDs in a database,
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code> stores XID
    statistics in the system tables <code class="structname">pg_class</code> and
    <code class="structname">pg_database</code>.  In particular,
    the <code class="structfield">relfrozenxid</code> column of a table's
    <code class="structname">pg_class</code> row contains the freeze cutoff XID that was used
    by the last <code class="command">VACUUM</code> for that table.  All normal
    XIDs older than this cutoff XID are guaranteed to have been replaced by
    <code class="literal">FrozenXID</code> within the table.  Similarly,
    the <code class="structfield">datfrozenxid</code> column of a database's
    <code class="structname">pg_database</code> row is a lower bound on the normal XIDs
    appearing in that database &#8212; it is just the minimum of the
    per-table <code class="structfield">relfrozenxid</code> values within the database.
    A convenient way to
    examine this information is to execute queries such as

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT relname, age(relfrozenxid) FROM pg_class WHERE relkind = 'r';
SELECT datname, age(datfrozenxid) FROM pg_database;</pre>
<p>

    The <code class="literal">age</code> column measures the number of transactions from the
    cutoff XID to the current transaction's XID.  Immediately after a
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code>, <code class="literal">age(relfrozenxid)</code> should be a little
    more than the <code class="varname">vacuum_freeze_min_age</code> setting that was used
    (more by the number of transactions started since the <code class="command">VACUUM</code>
    started).  If <code class="literal">age(relfrozenxid)</code> exceeds
    <code class="varname">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code>, an autovacuum will soon be forced
    for the table.
   </p>
<p>    If for some reason autovacuum fails to clear old XIDs from a table,
    the system will begin to emit warning messages like this when the
    database's oldest XIDs reach ten million transactions from the wraparound
    point:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">WARNING:  database "mydb" must be vacuumed within 177009986 transactions
HINT:  To avoid a database shutdown, execute a full-database VACUUM in "mydb".</pre>
<p>

    If these warnings are
    ignored, the system will shut down and refuse to execute any new
    transactions once there are fewer than 1 million transactions left
    until wraparound:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">ERROR:  database is shut down to avoid wraparound data loss in database "mydb"
HINT:  Stop the postmaster and use a standalone backend to VACUUM in "mydb".</pre>
<p>

    The 1-million-transaction safety margin exists to let the
    administrator recover without data loss, by manually executing the
    required <code class="command">VACUUM</code> commands.  However, since the system will not
    execute commands once it has gone into the safety shutdown mode,
    the only way to do this is to stop the server and use a single-user
    backend to execute <code class="command">VACUUM</code>.  The shutdown mode is not enforced
    by a single-user backend.  See the <a class="xref" href="app-postgres.html" title="postgres"><span class="refentrytitle"><span class="application">postgres</span></span></a> reference
    page for details about using a single-user backend.

Also,
    it's important to allow a slot for the autovacuum process when choosing
    the value of <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-connection.html#guc-superuser-reserved-connections">superuser_reserved_connections</a>.
   </p>
<p>    The autovacuum daemon, when enabled, runs every <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#guc-autovacuum-naptime">autovacuum_naptime</a> seconds.  On each run, it selects
    one database to process and checks each table within that database.
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code> or <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> commands are
    issued as needed.
   </p>
<p>    Tables whose <code class="structfield">relfrozenxid</code> value is more than
    <code class="varname">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code> transactions old are always
    vacuumed.  Otherwise,
    two conditions are used to determine which operation(s)
    to apply.  If the number of obsolete tuples since the last
    <code class="command">VACUUM</code> exceeds the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vacuum threshold</span>&#8221;</span>, the
    table is vacuumed.  The vacuum threshold is defined as:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">vacuum threshold = vacuum base threshold + vacuum scale factor * number of tuples</pre>
<p>
    where the vacuum base threshold is
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#guc-autovacuum-vacuum-threshold">autovacuum_vacuum_threshold</a>,
    the vacuum scale factor is
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#guc-autovacuum-vacuum-scale-factor">autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor</a>,
    and the number of tuples is
    <code class="structname">pg_class</code>.<code class="structfield">reltuples</code>.
    The number of obsolete tuples is obtained from the statistics
    collector; it is a semi-accurate count updated by each
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code> and <code class="command">DELETE</code> operation.  (It
    is only semi-accurate because some information may be lost under heavy
    load.)  For analyze, a similar condition is used: the threshold, defined as
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">analyze threshold = analyze base threshold + analyze scale factor * number of tuples</pre>
<p>
    is compared to the total number of tuples inserted, updated, or deleted
    since the last <code class="command">ANALYZE</code>.
   </p>
<p>    The default thresholds and scale factors are taken from
    <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>, but it is possible to override them
    on a table-by-table basis by making entries in the system catalog
    <a class="link" href="catalog-pg-autovacuum.html" title="43.10. pg_autovacuum"><code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code></a>.
    If a <code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code> row exists for a particular
    table, the settings it specifies are applied; otherwise the global
    settings are used.  See <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-autovacuum.html" title="17.9. Automatic Vacuuming">Section 17.9, &#8220;Automatic Vacuuming&#8221;</a> for
    more details on the global settings.
   </p>
<p>    Besides the base threshold values and scale factors, there are five
    more parameters that can be set for each table in
    <code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code>.
    The first, <code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code>.<code class="structfield">enabled</code>,
    can be set to <code class="literal">false</code> to instruct the autovacuum daemon
    to skip that particular table entirely.  In this case
    autovacuum will only touch the table if it must do so
    to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
    The next two parameters, the vacuum cost delay
    (<code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code>.<code class="structfield">vac_cost_delay</code>)
    and the vacuum cost limit
    (<code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code>.<code class="structfield">vac_cost_limit</code>), 
    are used to set table-specific values for the
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-resource.html#runtime-config-resource-vacuum-cost" title="17.4.4.  Cost-Based Vacuum Delay">       Cost-Based Vacuum Delay
     </a>
    feature.
    The last two parameters,
    (<code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code>.<code class="structfield">freeze_min_age</code>)
    and
    (<code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code>.<code class="structfield">freeze_max_age</code>), 
    are used to set table-specific values for
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#guc-vacuum-freeze-min-age">vacuum_freeze_min_age</a> and
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#guc-autovacuum-freeze-max-age">autovacuum_freeze_max_age</a> respectively.
   </p>
<p>    If any of the values in <code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code>
    are set to a negative number, or if a row is not present at all in
    <code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code> for any particular table, the
    corresponding values from <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> are used.
   </p>
<p>    There is not currently any support for making
    <code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code> entries, except by doing
    manual <code class="command">INSERT</code>s into the catalog.  This feature will be
    improved in future releases, and it is likely that the catalog
    definition will change.

<p>     The contents of the <code class="structname">pg_autovacuum</code> system
     catalog are currently not saved in database dumps created by
     the tools <code class="command">pg_dump</code> and <code class="command">pg_dumpall</code>.
     If you want to preserve them across a dump/reload cycle, make sure you
     dump the catalog manually.
