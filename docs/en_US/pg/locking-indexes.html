<a name="id2658541"></a><p>    Though <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    provides nonblocking read/write access to table
    data, nonblocking read/write access is not currently offered for every
    index access method implemented
    in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.
    The various index types are handled as follows:

    </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">       B-tree and <acronym class="acronym">GiST</acronym> indexes
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Short-term share/exclusive page-level locks are used for
        read/write access. Locks are released immediately after each
        index row is fetched or inserted.  These index types provide
        the highest concurrency without deadlock conditions.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Hash indexes
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Share/exclusive hash-bucket-level locks are used for read/write
        access.  Locks are released after the whole bucket is processed.
        Bucket-level locks provide better concurrency than index-level
        ones, but deadlock is possible since the locks are held longer
        than one index operation.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       <acronym class="acronym">GIN</acronym> indexes
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Short-term share/exclusive page-level locks are used for
        read/write access. Locks are released immediately after each
        index row is fetched or inserted. But note that a GIN-indexed
        value insertion usually produces several index key insertions
        per row, so GIN may do substantial work for a single value's
        insertion.
       </p></dd>

<p>    Currently, B-tree indexes offer the best performance for concurrent
    applications; since they also have more features than hash
    indexes, they are the recommended index type for concurrent
    applications that need to index scalar data. When dealing with
    non-scalar data, B-trees are not useful, and GiST or GIN indexes should
    be used instead.
