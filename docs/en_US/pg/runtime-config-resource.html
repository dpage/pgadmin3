        not support it (as determined during <span class="application">initdb</span>).
        This setting must be at least 128 kilobytes and at least 16

        values of <code class="symbol">BLCKSZ</code> change the minimum.)  However,

<p>        If you are not using prepared transactions, this parameter may as

        Note that for a complex query, several sort or hash operations might be
        running in parallel; each one will be allowed to use as much memory
        as this value specifies before it starts to put data into temporary

        an installation normally doesn't have many of them running

<dd>
<p>        Specifies the maximum safe depth of the server's execution stack.
        The ideal setting for this parameter is the actual stack size limit
        enforced by the kernel (as set by <code class="literal">ulimit -s</code> or local
        equivalent), less a safety margin of a megabyte or so.  The safety
        margin is needed because the stack depth is not checked in every
        routine in the server, but only in key potentially-recursive routines
        such as expression evaluation.  The default setting is two
        megabytes (<code class="literal">2MB</code>), which is conservatively small and
        unlikely to risk crashes.  However, it may be too small to allow
        execution of complex functions.  Only superusers can change this
        setting.
       </p>
<p>        Setting <code class="varname">max_stack_depth</code> higher than
        the actual kernel limit will mean that a runaway recursive function
        can crash an individual backend process.  On platforms where
        <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> can determine the kernel limit,
        it will not let you set this variable to an unsafe value.  However,
        not all platforms provide the information, so caution is recommended

<p>        <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> procedural language

<p>        By preloading a shared library, the library startup time is avoided

<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>        On Windows hosts, preloading a library at server start will not reduce
        the time required to start each new server process; each server process
        will re-load all preload libraries.  However, <code class="varname">shared_preload_libraries

        need to perform certain operations that only take place at postmaster start
        (for example, a shared library may need to reserve lightweight locks
        or shared memory and you can't do that after the postmaster has started).

<p>        If a specified library is not found,

<p>      During the execution of <a class="xref" href="sql-vacuum.html" title="VACUUM">VACUUM</a> and <a class="xref" href="sql-analyze.html" title="ANALYZE">ANALYZE</a> commands, the system maintains an
      internal counter that keeps track of the estimated cost of the
      various I/O operations that are performed.  When the accumulated
      cost reaches a limit (specified by
      <code class="varname">vacuum_cost_limit</code>), the process performing
      the operation will sleep for a while (specified by
      <code class="varname">vacuum_cost_delay</code>). Then it will reset the
      counter and continue execution.
     </p>
<p>      The intent of this feature is to allow administrators to reduce
      the I/O impact of these commands on concurrent database
      activity. There are many situations in which it is not very
      important that maintenance commands like
      <code class="command">VACUUM</code> and <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> finish
      quickly; however, it is usually very important that these

      delay provides a way for administrators to achieve this.

<p>      Beginning in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.0, there is a separate server
      process called the <em class="firstterm">background writer</em>, whose sole function
      is to issue writes of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">dirty</span>&#8221;</span> shared buffers.  The intent is
      that server processes handling user queries should seldom or never have
      to wait for a write to occur, because the background writer will do it.
      This arrangement also reduces the performance penalty associated with
      checkpoints.  The background writer will continuously trickle out dirty
      pages to disk, so that only a few pages will need to be forced out when
      checkpoint time arrives, instead of the storm of dirty-buffer writes that
      formerly occurred at each checkpoint.  However there is a net overall
      increase in I/O load, because where a repeatedly-dirtied page might
      before have been written only once per checkpoint interval, the
      background writer might write it several times in the same interval.
      In most situations a continuous low load is preferable to periodic
      spikes, but the parameters discussed in this subsection can be used to tune
      the behavior for local needs.

<dd><p>         To reduce the amount of work that will be needed at checkpoint time,
         the background writer also does a circular scan through the entire
         buffer pool, writing buffers that are found to be dirty.
         In each round, it examines up to
         <code class="varname">bgwriter_all_percent</code> of the buffers for this purpose.
         The default value is 0.333 (0.333% of the total number
         of shared buffers).  With the default <code class="varname">bgwriter_delay</code>
         setting, this will allow the entire shared buffer pool to be scanned
         about once per minute.
         This parameter can only be set in the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>
         file or on the server command line.

<dd><p>         In each round, no more than this many buffers will be written
         as a result of the scan of the entire buffer pool.  (If this
         limit is reached, the scan stops, and resumes at the next buffer
         during the next round.)
         The default value is five buffers.
         This parameter can only be set in the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>
         file or on the server command line.

<p>      Smaller values of <code class="varname">bgwriter_all_percent</code> and
      <code class="varname">bgwriter_all_maxpages</code> reduce the extra I/O load
      caused by the background writer, but leave more work to be done
      at checkpoint time.  To reduce load spikes at checkpoints,
      increase these two values.
      Similarly, smaller values of <code class="varname">bgwriter_lru_percent</code> and
      <code class="varname">bgwriter_lru_maxpages</code> reduce the extra I/O load
      caused by the background writer, but make it more likely that server
      processes will have to issue writes for themselves, delaying interactive
      queries.
      To disable background writing entirely,
      set both <code class="varname">maxpages</code> values and/or both
      <code class="varname">percent</code> values to zero.
