<p>   Traditionally, implementing a new index access method meant a lot of
   difficult work.  It was necessary to understand the inner workings of the
   database, such as the lock manager and Write-Ahead Log.  The
   <acronym class="acronym">GiST</acronym> interface has a high level of abstraction,
   requiring the access method implementer to only implement the semantics of
   the data type being accessed.  The <acronym class="acronym">GiST</acronym> layer itself
   takes care of concurrency, logging and searching the tree structure.
 </p>
<p>   This extensibility should not be confused with the extensibility of the
   other standard search trees in terms of the data they can handle.  For
   example, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports extensible B-trees
   and hash indexes. That means that you can use
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> to build a B-tree or hash over any
   data type you want. But B-trees only support range predicates
   (<code class="literal">&lt;</code>, <code class="literal">=</code>, <code class="literal">&gt;</code>),
   and hash indexes only support equality queries.
 </p>
<p>   So if you index, say, an image collection with a
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> B-tree, you can only issue queries
   such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">is imagex equal to imagey</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">is imagex less
   than imagey</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">is imagex greater than imagey</span>&#8221;</span>?
   Depending on how you define <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">equals</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">less than</span>&#8221;</span>
   and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">greater than</span>&#8221;</span> in this context, this could be useful.
   However, by using a <acronym class="acronym">GiST</acronym> based index, you could create
   ways to ask domain-specific questions, perhaps <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">find all images of
   horses</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">find all over-exposed images</span>&#8221;</span>.
 </p>
<p>   All it takes to get a <acronym class="acronym">GiST</acronym> access method up and running
   is to implement seven user-defined methods, which define the behavior of
   keys in the tree. Of course these methods have to be pretty fancy to
   support fancy queries, but for all the standard queries (B-trees,
   R-trees, etc.) they're relatively straightforward. In short,
   <acronym class="acronym">GiST</acronym> combines extensibility along with generality, code
   reuse, and a clean interface.
