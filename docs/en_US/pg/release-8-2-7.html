<p>   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.6.

<p>    A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X.
    However, you might need to <code class="command">REINDEX</code> indexes on textual
    columns after updating, if you are affected by the Windows locale
    issue described below.

<li class="listitem">
<p>      Fix character string comparison for Windows locales that consider
      different character combinations as equal (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This fix applies only on Windows and only when using UTF-8
      database encoding.  The same fix was made for all other cases
      over two years ago, but Windows with UTF-8 uses a separate code
      path that was not updated.  If you are using a locale that
      considers some non-identical strings as equal, you may need to
      <code class="command">REINDEX</code> to fix existing indexes on textual columns.
     </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>      Repair potential deadlock between concurrent <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code>
      operations on different system catalogs (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>      Fix longstanding <code class="command">LISTEN</code>/<code class="command">NOTIFY</code>
      race condition (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      In rare cases a session that had just executed a
      <code class="command">LISTEN</code> might not get a notification, even though
      one would be expected because the concurrent transaction executing
      <code class="command">NOTIFY</code> was observed to commit later.
     </p>
<p>      A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed
      a not-yet-committed <code class="command">LISTEN</code> command will not see any
      row in <code class="structname">pg_listener</code> for the <code class="command">LISTEN</code>,
      should it choose to look; formerly it would have.  This behavior
      was never documented one way or the other, but it is possible that
      some applications depend on the old behavior.

</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>      Disallow <code class="command">LISTEN</code> and <code class="command">UNLISTEN</code> within a
      prepared transaction (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This was formerly allowed but trying to do it had various unpleasant
      consequences, notably that the originating backend could not exit
      as long as an <code class="command">UNLISTEN</code> remained uncommitted.
     </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>      Disallow dropping a temporary table within a
      prepared transaction (Heikki)
     </p>
<p>      This was correctly disallowed by 8.1, but the check was inadvertently
      broken in 8.2.

<p>      Fix input of datetime values for February 29 in years BC (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      The former coding was mistaken about which years were leap years.

<li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">unrecognized node type</span>&#8221;</span> error in some variants of

<li class="listitem"><p>      Update time zone data files to <span class="application">tzdata</span> release 2008a
      (in particular, recent Chile changes); adjust timezone abbreviation
      <code class="literal">VET</code> (Venezuela) to mean UTC-4:30, not UTC-4:00 (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> to correctly extract the postmaster's port
      number from command-line options (Itagaki Takahiro, Tom)
     </p>
<p>      Previously, <code class="literal">pg_ctl start -w</code> could try to contact the
      postmaster on the wrong port, leading to bogus reports of startup
      failure.

<p>      Use <code class="option">-fwrapv</code> to defend against possible misoptimization
      in recent <span class="application">gcc</span> versions (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This is known to be necessary when building <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
      with <span class="application">gcc</span> 4.3 or later.

<p>      Correctly enforce <code class="varname">statement_timeout</code> values longer
      than <code class="literal">INT_MAX</code> microseconds (about 35 minutes) (Tom)

<p>      This bug affects only builds with <code class="option">--enable-integer-datetimes</code>.

<li class="listitem">
<p>      Fix logical errors in constraint-exclusion handling of <code class="literal">IS
      NULL</code> and <code class="literal">NOT</code> expressions (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      The planner would sometimes exclude partitions that should not
      have been excluded because of the possibility of NULL results.
     </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>      Fix another cause of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">failed to build any N-way joins</span>&#8221;</span>
      planner errors (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This could happen in cases where a clauseless join needed to be
      forced before a join clause could be exploited.
     </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>      Fix incorrect constant propagation in outer-join planning (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      The planner could sometimes incorrectly conclude that a variable
      could be constrained to be equal to a constant, leading
      to wrong query results.
     </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>      Fix display of constant expressions in <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code>
      and <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      An explictly casted constant would be shown incorrectly.  This could
      for example lead to corruption of a view definition during
      dump and reload.
     </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>      Fix <span class="application">libpq</span> to handle NOTICE messages correctly
      during COPY OUT (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This failure has only been observed to occur when a user-defined
      datatype's output routine issues a NOTICE, but there is no
      guarantee it couldn't happen due to other causes.
