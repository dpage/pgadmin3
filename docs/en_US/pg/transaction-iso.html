<a name="id2656569"></a><p>    The <acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym> standard defines four levels of
    transaction isolation in terms of three phenomena that must be
    prevented between concurrent transactions.  These undesirable
    phenomena are:

<br class="table-break"><p>    In <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, you can request any of the
    four standard transaction isolation levels.  But internally, there are
    only two distinct isolation levels, which correspond to the levels Read
    Committed and Serializable.  When you select the level Read
    Uncommitted you really get Read Committed, and when you select
    Repeatable Read you really get Serializable, so the actual
    isolation level may be stricter than what you select.  This is
    permitted by the SQL standard: the four isolation levels only
    define which phenomena must not happen, they do not define which
    phenomena must happen.  The reason that <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    only provides two isolation levels is that this is the only
    sensible way to map the standard isolation levels to the multiversion
    concurrency control architecture.  The behavior of the available
    isolation levels is detailed in the following subsections.
   </p>
<p>    To set the transaction isolation level of a transaction, use the
    command <a class="xref" href="sql-set-transaction.html" title="SET TRANSACTION">SET TRANSACTION</a>.
   </p>
<div class="sect2" title="12.2.1. Read Committed Isolation Level">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="xact-read-committed">12.2.1. Read Committed Isolation Level</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2656785"></a><p>    <em class="firstterm">Read Committed</em>
    is the default isolation level in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>. 
    When a transaction runs on this isolation level,
    a <code class="command">SELECT</code> query sees only data committed before the
    query began; it never sees either uncommitted data or changes committed
    during query execution by concurrent transactions.  (However, the
    <code class="command">SELECT</code> does see the effects of previous updates
    executed within its own transaction, even though they are not yet
    committed.)  In effect, a <code class="command">SELECT</code> query
    sees a snapshot of the database as of the instant that that query
    begins to run.  Notice that two successive <code class="command">SELECT</code> commands can
    see different data, even though they are within a single transaction, if
    other transactions 
    commit changes during execution of the first <code class="command">SELECT</code>.
   </p>
<p>    <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, <code class="command">DELETE</code>, <code class="command">SELECT
    FOR UPDATE</code>, and <code class="command">SELECT FOR SHARE</code> commands
    behave the same as <code class="command">SELECT</code>
    in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows
    that were committed as of the command start time.  However, such a target
    row may have already been updated (or deleted or locked) by
    another concurrent transaction by the time it is found.  In this case, the
    would-be updater will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or
    roll back (if it is still in progress).  If the first updater rolls back,
    then its effects are negated and the second updater can proceed with
    updating the originally found row.  If the first updater commits, the
    second updater will ignore the row if the first updater deleted it,
    otherwise it will attempt to apply its operation to the updated version of
    the row.  The search condition of the command (the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause) is
    re-evaluated to see if the updated version of the row still matches the
    search condition.  If so, the second updater proceeds with its operation,
    starting from the updated version of the row.  (In the case of
    <code class="command">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code> and <code class="command">SELECT FOR
    SHARE</code>, that means it is the updated version of the row that is
    locked and returned to the client.)
   </p>
<p>    Because of the above rule, it is possible for an updating command to see an
    inconsistent snapshot: it can see the effects of concurrent updating
    commands that affected the same rows it is trying to update, but it
    does not see effects of those commands on other rows in the database.
    This behavior makes Read Committed mode unsuitable for commands that
    involve complex search conditions.  However, it is just right for simpler
    cases.  For example, consider updating bank balances with transactions
    like

</p>
<pre class="screen">BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 7534;
COMMIT;</pre>
<p>

    If two such transactions concurrently try to change the balance of account
    12345, we clearly want the second transaction to start from the updated
    version of the account's row.  Because each command is affecting only a
    predetermined row, letting it see the updated version of the row does
    not create any troublesome inconsistency.
   </p>
<p>    Since in Read Committed mode each new command starts with a new snapshot
    that includes all transactions committed up to that instant, subsequent
    commands in the same transaction will see the effects of the committed
    concurrent transaction in any case.  The point at issue here is whether
    or not within a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> command we see an absolutely consistent
    view of the database.
   </p>
<p>    The partial transaction isolation provided by Read Committed mode is
    adequate for many applications, and this mode is fast and simple to use.
    However, for applications that do complex queries and updates, it may
    be necessary to guarantee a more rigorously consistent view of the
    database than the Read Committed mode provides.
   </p>

<div class="sect2" title="12.2.2. Serializable Isolation Level">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="xact-serializable">12.2.2. Serializable Isolation Level</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2656971"></a><p>    The level <em class="firstterm">Serializable</em> provides the strictest transaction
    isolation.  This level emulates serial transaction execution,
    as if transactions had been executed one after another, serially,
    rather than concurrently.  However, applications using this level must
    be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization failures.
   </p>
<p>    When a transaction is on the serializable level,
    a <code class="command">SELECT</code> query sees only data committed before the
    transaction began; it never sees either uncommitted data or changes
    committed
    during transaction execution by concurrent transactions.  (However, the
    <code class="command">SELECT</code> does see the effects of previous updates
    executed within its own transaction, even though they are not yet
    committed.)  This is different from Read Committed in that the
    <code class="command">SELECT</code>
    sees a snapshot as of the start of the transaction, not as of the start
    of the current query within the transaction.  Thus, successive
    <code class="command">SELECT</code> commands within a single transaction always see the same
    data.
   </p>
<p>    <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, <code class="command">DELETE</code>, <code class="command">SELECT
    FOR UPDATE</code>, and <code class="command">SELECT FOR SHARE</code> commands
    behave the same as <code class="command">SELECT</code>
    in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows
    that were committed as of the transaction start time.  However, such a
    target
    row may have already been updated (or deleted or locked) by
    another concurrent transaction by the time it is found.  In this case, the
    serializable transaction will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or
    roll back (if it is still in progress).  If the first updater rolls back,
    then its effects are negated and the serializable transaction can proceed
    with updating the originally found row.  But if the first updater commits
    (and actually updated or deleted the row, not just locked it)
    then the serializable transaction will be rolled back with the message

</p>
<pre class="screen">ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update</pre>
<p>

    because a serializable transaction cannot modify or lock rows changed by
    other transactions after the serializable transaction began.
   </p>
<p>    When the application receives this error message, it should abort
    the current transaction and then retry the whole transaction from
    the beginning.  The second time through, the transaction sees the
    previously-committed change as part of its initial view of the database,
    so there is no logical conflict in using the new version of the row
    as the starting point for the new transaction's update.
   </p>
<p>    Note that only updating transactions may need to be retried; read-only
    transactions will never have serialization conflicts.
   </p>
<p>    The Serializable mode provides a rigorous guarantee that each
    transaction sees a wholly consistent view of the database.  However,
    the application has to be prepared to retry transactions when concurrent
    updates make it impossible to sustain the illusion of serial execution.
    Since the cost of redoing complex transactions may be significant,
    this mode is recommended only when updating transactions contain logic
    sufficiently complex that they may give wrong answers in Read
    Committed mode.  Most commonly, Serializable mode is necessary when
    a transaction executes several successive commands that must see
    identical views of the database.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="mvcc-serializability">12.2.2.1. Serializable Isolation versus True Serializability</h4></div></div></div>
<a name="id2657126"></a><a name="id2657131"></a><p>    The intuitive meaning (and mathematical definition) of
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">serializable</span>&#8221;</span> execution is that any two successfully committed
    concurrent transactions will appear to have executed strictly serially,
    one after the other &#8212; although which one appeared to occur first may
    not be predictable in advance.  It is important to realize that forbidding
    the undesirable behaviors listed in <a class="xref" href="transaction-iso.html#mvcc-isolevel-table" title="Table 12.1. SQL Transaction Isolation Levels">Table 12.1, &#8220;<acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym> Transaction Isolation Levels&#8221;</a>
    is not sufficient to guarantee true serializability, and in fact
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>'s Serializable mode <span class="emphasis"><em>does
    not guarantee serializable execution in this sense</em></span>.  As an example,
    consider a table <code class="structname">mytab</code>, initially containing
</p>
<pre class="screen"> class | value 
-------+-------
     1 |    10
     1 |    20
     2 |   100
     2 |   200</pre>
<p>
    Suppose that serializable transaction A computes
</p>
<pre class="screen">SELECT SUM(value) FROM mytab WHERE class = 1;</pre>
<p>
    and then inserts the result (30) as the <code class="structfield">value</code> in a
    new row with <code class="structfield">class</code> = 2.  Concurrently, serializable
    transaction B computes
</p>
<pre class="screen">SELECT SUM(value) FROM mytab WHERE class = 2;</pre>
<p>
    and obtains the result 300, which it inserts in a new row with
    <code class="structfield">class</code> = 1.  Then both transactions commit.  None of
    the listed undesirable behaviors have occurred, yet we have a result
    that could not have occurred in either order serially.  If A had
    executed before B, B would have computed the sum 330, not 300, and
    similarly the other order would have resulted in a different sum
    computed by A.
   </p>
<p>    To guarantee true mathematical serializability, it is necessary for
    a database system to enforce <em class="firstterm">predicate locking</em>, which
    means that a transaction cannot insert or modify a row that would
    have matched the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition of a query in another concurrent
    transaction.  For example, once transaction A has executed the query
    <code class="literal">SELECT ... WHERE class = 1</code>, a predicate-locking system
    would forbid transaction B from inserting any new row with class 1
    until A has committed.
     <sup>[<a name="id2657239" href="#ftn.id2657239" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup>
    Such a locking system is complex to
    implement and extremely expensive in execution, since every session must
    be aware of the details of every query executed by every concurrent
    transaction.  And this large expense is mostly wasted, since in
    practice most applications do not do the sorts of things that could
    result in problems.  (Certainly the example above is rather contrived
    and unlikely to represent real software.)  For these reasons,
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> does not implement predicate
    locking.
   </p>
<p>    In those cases where the possibility of nonserializable execution
    is a real hazard, problems can be prevented by appropriate use of
    explicit locking.  Further discussion appears in the following
    sections.
