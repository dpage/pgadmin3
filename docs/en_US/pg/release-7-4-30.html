<p>   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.29.
   For information about new features in the 7.4 major release, see
   <a class="xref" href="release-7-4.html" title="E.104. Release 7.4">Section E.104, &#8220;Release 7.4&#8221;</a>.
  </p>
<p>   This is expected to be the last <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> release
   in the 7.4.X series.  Users are encouraged to update to a newer
   release branch soon.

<p>      Use a separate interpreter for each calling SQL userid in PL/Perl and
      PL/Tcl (Tom Lane)
     </p>
<p>      This change prevents security problems that can be caused by subverting
      Perl or Tcl code that will be executed later in the same session under
      another SQL user identity (for example, within a <code class="literal">SECURITY
      DEFINER</code> function).  Most scripting languages offer numerous ways that
      that might be done, such as redefining standard functions or operators
      called by the target function.  Without this change, any SQL user with
      Perl or Tcl language usage rights can do essentially anything with the
      SQL privileges of the target function's owner.
     </p>
<p>      The cost of this change is that intentional communication among Perl
      and Tcl functions becomes more difficult.  To provide an escape hatch,
      PL/PerlU and PL/TclU functions continue to use only one interpreter
      per session.  This is not considered a security issue since all such
      functions execute at the trust level of a database superuser already.
     </p>
<p>      It is likely that third-party procedural languages that claim to offer
      trusted execution have similar security issues.  We advise contacting
      the authors of any PL you are depending on for security-critical
      purposes.
     </p>
<p>      Our thanks to Tim Bunce for pointing out this issue (CVE-2010-3433).

<p>      This omission could result in corrupted lockfile contents if the
      machine crashes shortly after postmaster start.  That could in turn
      prevent subsequent attempts to start the postmaster from succeeding,
      until the lockfile is manually removed.
