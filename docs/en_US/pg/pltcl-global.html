<a name="id2762066"></a><p>     Sometimes it
     is useful to have some global data that is held between two
     calls to a function or is shared between different functions.
     This is easily done in PL/Tcl, but there are some restrictions that
     must be understood.
    </p>
<p>     For security reasons, PL/Tcl executes functions called by any one SQL
     role in a separate Tcl interpreter for that role.  This prevents
     accidental or malicious interference by one user with the behavior of
     another user's PL/Tcl functions.  Each such interpreter will have its own
     values for any <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">global</span>&#8221;</span> Tcl variables.  Thus, two PL/Tcl
     functions will share the same global variables if and only if they are
     executed by the same SQL role.  In an application wherein a single
     session executes code under multiple SQL roles (via <code class="literal">SECURITY
     DEFINER</code> functions, use of <code class="command">SET ROLE</code>, etc) you may need to
     take explicit steps to ensure that PL/Tcl functions can share data.  To
     do that, make sure that functions that should communicate are owned by
     the same user, and mark them <code class="literal">SECURITY DEFINER</code>.  You must of
     course take care that such functions can't be used to do anything
     unintended.
    </p>
<p>     All PL/TclU functions used in a session execute in the same Tcl
     interpreter, which of course is distinct from the interpreter(s)
     used for PL/Tcl functions.  So global data is automatically shared
     between PL/TclU functions.  This is not considered a security risk
     because all PL/TclU functions execute at the same trust level,
     namely that of a database superuser.
    </p>
<p>     To help protect PL/Tcl functions from unintentionally interfering
     with each other, a global
     array is made available to each function via the <code class="function">upvar</code>
     command. The global name of this variable is the function's internal
     name, and the local name is <code class="literal">GD</code>.  It is recommended that
     <code class="literal">GD</code> be used
     for persistent private data of a function.  Use regular Tcl global
     variables only for values that you specifically intend to be shared among
     multiple functions.  (Note that the <code class="literal">GD</code> arrays are only
     global within a particular interpreter, so they do not bypass the
     security restrictions mentioned above.)
    </p>
<p>     An example of using <code class="literal">GD</code> appears in the
     <code class="function">spi_execp</code> example below.
