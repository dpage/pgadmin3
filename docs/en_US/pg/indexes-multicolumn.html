<a name="id2655009"></a><p>   An index can be defined on more than one column of a table.  For example, if
   you have a table of this form:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE test2 (
  major int,
  minor int,
  name varchar
);</pre>
<p>
   (say, you keep your <code class="filename">/dev</code>
   directory in a database...) and you frequently make queries like
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT name FROM test2 WHERE major = <em class="replaceable"><code>constant</code></em> AND minor = <em class="replaceable"><code>constant</code></em>;</pre>
<p>
   then it may be appropriate to define an index on the columns
   <code class="structfield">major</code> and
   <code class="structfield">minor</code> together, e.g.,
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 (major, minor);</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Currently, only the B-tree and GiST index types support multicolumn
   indexes.  Up to 32 columns may be specified.  (This limit can be
   altered when building <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>; see the
   file <code class="filename">pg_config_manual.h</code>.)
  </p>
<p>   A multicolumn B-tree index can be used with query conditions that
   involve any subset of the index's columns, but the index is most
   efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns.
   The exact rule is that equality constraints on leading columns, plus
   any inequality constraints on the first column that does not have an
   equality constraint, will be used to limit the portion of the index
   that is scanned.  Constraints on columns to the right of these columns
   are checked in the index, so they save visits to the table proper, but
   they do not reduce the portion of the index that has to be scanned.
   For example, given an index on <code class="literal">(a, b, c)</code> and a
   query condition <code class="literal">WHERE a = 5 AND b &gt;= 42 AND c &lt; 77</code>,
   the index would have to be scanned from the first entry with
   <code class="literal">a</code> = 5 and <code class="literal">b</code> = 42 up through the last entry with
   <code class="literal">a</code> = 5.  Index entries with <code class="literal">c</code> &gt;= 77 would be
   skipped, but they'd still have to be scanned through.
   This index could in principle be used for queries that have constraints
   on <code class="literal">b</code> and/or <code class="literal">c</code> with no constraint on <code class="literal">a</code>
   &#8212; but the entire index would have to be scanned, so in most cases
   the planner would prefer a sequential table scan over using the index.
  </p>
<p>   A multicolumn GiST index can be used with query conditions that
   involve any subset of the index's columns. Conditions on additional 
   columns restrict the entries returned by the index, but the condition on 
   the first column is the most important one for determining how much of 
   the index needs to be scanned.  A GiST index will be relatively 
   ineffective if its first column has only a few distinct values, even if 
   there are many distinct values in additional columns.
  </p>
<p>   Of course, each column must be used with operators appropriate to the index
   type; clauses that involve other operators will not be considered.
  </p>
<p>   Multicolumn indexes should be used sparingly.  In most situations,
   an index on a single column is sufficient and saves space and time.
   Indexes with more than three columns are unlikely to be helpful
   unless the usage of the table is extremely stylized.  See also
   <a class="xref" href="indexes-bitmap-scans.html" title="11.4. Combining Multiple Indexes">Section 11.4, &#8220;Combining Multiple Indexes&#8221;</a> for some discussion of the
   merits of different index setups.
