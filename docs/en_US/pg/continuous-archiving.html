<a name="id2694976"></a><a name="id2694985"></a><a name="id2694994"></a><p>   At all times, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> maintains a
   <em class="firstterm">write ahead log</em> (WAL) in the <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code>
   subdirectory of the cluster's data directory. The log describes
   every change made to the database's data files.  This log exists
   primarily for crash-safety purposes: if the system crashes, the
   database can be restored to consistency by <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">replaying</span>&#8221;</span> the
   log entries made since the last checkpoint.  However, the existence
   of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up
   databases: we can combine a file-system-level backup with backup of
   the WAL files.  If recovery is needed, we restore the backup and
   then replay from the backed-up WAL files to bring the backup up to
   current time.  This approach is more complex to administer than
   either of the previous approaches, but it has some significant
   benefits:
  </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>     We do not need a perfectly consistent backup as the starting point.
     Any internal inconsistency in the backup will be corrected by log
     replay (this is not significantly different from what happens during
     crash recovery).  So we don't need file system snapshot capability,
     just <span class="application">tar</span> or a similar archiving tool.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Since we can string together an indefinitely long sequence of WAL files
     for replay, continuous backup can be achieved simply by continuing to archive
     the WAL files.  This is particularly valuable for large databases, where
     it may not be convenient to take a full backup frequently.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     There is nothing that says we have to replay the WAL entries all the
     way to the end.  We could stop the replay at any point and have a
     consistent snapshot of the database as it was at that time.  Thus,
     this technique supports <em class="firstterm">point-in-time recovery</em>: it is
     possible to restore the database to its state at any time since your base
     backup was taken.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     If we continuously feed the series of WAL files to another
     machine that has been loaded with the same base backup file, we
     have a <em class="firstterm">warm standby</em> system: at any point we can bring up
     the second machine and it will have a nearly-current copy of the
     database.
    </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   As with the plain file-system-backup technique, this method can only
   support restoration of an entire database cluster, not a subset.
   Also, it requires a lot of archival storage: the base backup may be bulky,
   and a busy system will generate many megabytes of WAL traffic that
   have to be archived.  Still, it is the preferred backup technique in
   many situations where high reliability is needed.
  </p>
<p>   To recover successfully using continuous archiving (also called "online
   backup" by many database vendors), you need a continuous
   sequence of archived WAL files that extends back at least as far as the
   start time of your backup.  So to get started, you should setup and test
   your procedure for archiving WAL files <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> you take your
   first base backup.  Accordingly, we first discuss the mechanics of
   archiving WAL files.
  </p>
<div class="sect2" title="23.3.1. Setting up WAL archiving">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="backup-archiving-wal">23.3.1. Setting up WAL archiving</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    In an abstract sense, a running <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> system
    produces an indefinitely long sequence of WAL records.  The system
    physically divides this sequence into WAL <em class="firstterm">segment
    files</em>, which are normally 16MB apiece (although the size can be
    altered when building <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>).  The segment
    files are given numeric names that reflect their position in the
    abstract WAL sequence.  When not using WAL archiving, the system
    normally creates just a few segment files and then
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">recycles</span>&#8221;</span> them by renaming no-longer-needed segment files
    to higher segment numbers.  It's assumed that a segment file whose
    contents precede the checkpoint-before-last is no longer of
    interest and can be recycled.
   </p>
<p>    When archiving WAL data, we want to capture the contents of each segment
    file once it is filled, and save that data somewhere before the segment
    file is recycled for reuse.  Depending on the application and the
    available hardware, there could be many different ways of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">saving
    the data somewhere</span>&#8221;</span>: we could copy the segment files to an NFS-mounted
    directory on another machine, write them onto a tape drive (ensuring that
    you have a way of identifying the original name of each file), or batch
    them together and burn them onto CDs, or something else entirely.  To
    provide the database administrator with as much flexibility as possible,
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> tries not to make any assumptions about how 
    the archiving will be done.  Instead, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> lets
    the administrator specify a shell command to be executed to copy a
    completed segment file to wherever it needs to go.  The command could be
    as simple as a <code class="literal">cp</code>, or it could invoke a complex shell
    script &#8212; it's all up to you.
   </p>
<p>    The shell command to use is specified by the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#guc-archive-command">archive_command</a> configuration parameter, which in practice
    will always be placed in the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> file.
    In this string,
    any <code class="literal">%p</code> is replaced by the path name of the file to
    archive, while any <code class="literal">%f</code> is replaced by the file name only.
    (The path name is relative to the working directory of the server,
    i.e., the cluster's data directory.)
    Write <code class="literal">%%</code> if you need to embed an actual <code class="literal">%</code>
    character in the command.  The simplest useful command is something
    like
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">archive_command = 'cp -i %p /mnt/server/archivedir/%f &lt;/dev/null'</pre>
<p>
    which will copy archivable WAL segments to the directory
    <code class="filename">/mnt/server/archivedir</code>.  (This is an example, not a 
    recommendation, and may not work on all platforms.)
   </p>
<p>    The archive command will be executed under the ownership of the same
    user that the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server is running as.  Since
    the series of WAL files being archived contains effectively everything
    in your database, you will want to be sure that the archived data is
    protected from prying eyes; for example, archive into a directory that
    does not have group or world read access.
   </p>
<p>    It is important that the archive command return zero exit status if and
    only if it succeeded.  Upon getting a zero result,
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> will assume that the WAL segment file has been
    successfully archived, and will remove or recycle it.
    However, a nonzero status tells
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> that the file was not archived; it will try
    again periodically until it succeeds.
   </p>
<p>    The archive command should generally be designed to refuse to overwrite
    any pre-existing archive file.  This is an important safety feature to
    preserve the integrity of your archive in case of administrator error
    (such as sending the output of two different servers to the same archive
    directory).
    It is advisable to test your proposed archive command to ensure that it
    indeed does not overwrite an existing file, <span class="emphasis"><em>and that it returns
    nonzero status in this case</em></span>.  We have found that <code class="literal">cp -i</code> does
    this correctly on some platforms but not others.  If the chosen command
    does not itself handle this case correctly, you should add a command
    to test for pre-existence of the archive file.  For example, something
    like
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">archive_command = 'test ! -f .../%f &amp;&amp; cp %p .../%f'</pre>
<p>
    works correctly on most Unix variants.
   </p>
<p>    While designing your archiving setup, consider what will happen if
    the archive command fails repeatedly because some aspect requires 
    operator intervention or the archive runs out of space. For example, this
    could occur if you write to tape without an autochanger; when the tape 
    fills, nothing further can be archived until the tape is swapped.
    You should ensure that any error condition or request to a human operator
    is reported appropriately so that the situation can be 
    resolved relatively quickly. The <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code> directory will
    continue to fill with WAL segment files until the situation is resolved.
   </p>
<p>    The speed of the archiving command is not important, so long as it can keep up
    with the average rate at which your server generates WAL data.  Normal
    operation continues even if the archiving process falls a little behind.
    If archiving falls significantly behind, this will increase the amount of
    data that would be lost in the event of a disaster. It will also mean that
    the <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code> directory will contain large numbers of
    not-yet-archived segment files, which could eventually exceed available
    disk space. You are advised to monitor the archiving process to ensure that
    it is working as you intend.
   </p>
<p>    In writing your archive command, you should assume that the file names to
    be archived may be up to 64 characters long and may contain any
    combination of ASCII letters, digits, and dots.  It is not necessary to
    remember the original relative path (<code class="literal">%p</code>) but it is necessary to
    remember the file name (<code class="literal">%f</code>).
   </p>
<p>    Note that although WAL archiving will allow you to restore any
    modifications made to the data in your <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> database,
    it will not restore changes made to configuration files (that is,
    <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>, <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> and
    <code class="filename">pg_ident.conf</code>), since those are edited manually rather
    than through SQL operations.
    You may wish to keep the configuration files in a location that will
    be backed up by your regular file system backup procedures.  See
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-file-locations.html" title="17.2. File Locations">Section 17.2, &#8220;File Locations&#8221;</a> for how to relocate the
    configuration files.
   </p>
<p>    The archive command is only invoked on completed WAL segments.  Hence,
    if your server generates only little WAL traffic (or has slack periods 
    where it does so), there could be a long delay between the completion
    of a transaction and its safe recording in archive storage.  To put
    a limit on how old unarchived data can be, you can set
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#guc-archive-timeout">archive_timeout</a> to force the server to switch
    to a new WAL segment file at least that often.  Note that archived
    files that are ended early due to a forced switch are still the same
    length as completely full files.  It is therefore unwise to set a very
    short <code class="varname">archive_timeout</code> &#8212; it will bloat your archive
    storage.  <code class="varname">archive_timeout</code> settings of a minute or so are
    usually reasonable.
   </p>
<p>    Also, you can force a segment switch manually with
    <code class="function">pg_switch_xlog</code>, if you want to ensure that a
    just-finished transaction is archived immediately.  Other utility
    functions related to WAL management are listed in <a class="xref" href="functions-admin.html#functions-admin-backup-table" title="Table 9.47. Backup Control Functions">Table 9.47, &#8220;Backup Control Functions&#8221;</a>.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="backup-base-backup">23.3.2. Making a Base Backup</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    The procedure for making a base backup is relatively simple:
  </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem"><p>     Ensure that WAL archiving is enabled and working.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>     Connect to the database as a superuser, and issue the command
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT pg_start_backup('label');</pre>
<p>
     where <code class="literal">label</code> is any string you want to use to uniquely
     identify this backup operation.  (One good practice is to use the
     full path where you intend to put the backup dump file.)
     <code class="function">pg_start_backup</code> creates a <em class="firstterm">backup label</em> file,
     called <code class="filename">backup_label</code>, in the cluster directory with
     information about your backup.
    </p>
<p>     It does not matter which database within the cluster you connect to to 
     issue this command.  You can ignore the result returned by the function;
     but if it reports an error, deal with that before proceeding.
    </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Perform the backup, using any convenient file-system-backup tool
     such as <span class="application">tar</span> or <span class="application">cpio</span>.  It is neither
     necessary nor desirable to stop normal operation of the database
     while you do this.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>     Again connect to the database as a superuser, and issue the command
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT pg_stop_backup();</pre>
<p>
     This terminates the backup mode and performs an automatic switch to
     the next WAL segment.  The reason for the switch is to arrange that
     the last WAL segment file written during the backup interval is
     immediately ready to archive.
    </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Once the WAL segment files used during the backup are archived, you are
     done.  The file identified by <code class="function">pg_stop_backup</code>'s result is
     the last segment that needs to be archived to complete the backup.  
     Archival of these files will happen automatically, since you have
     already configured <code class="varname">archive_command</code>. In many cases, this
     happens fairly quickly, but you are advised to monitor your archival
     system to ensure this has taken place so that you can be certain you
     have a complete backup.  
    </p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    Some backup tools that you might wish to use emit warnings or errors
    if the files they are trying to copy change while the copy proceeds.
    This situation is normal, and not an error, when taking a base backup of
    an active database; so you need to ensure that you can distinguish
    complaints of this sort from real errors.  For example, some versions
    of <span class="application">rsync</span> return a separate exit code for <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vanished
    source files</span>&#8221;</span>, and you can write a driver script to accept this exit
    code as a non-error case.  Also, some versions of GNU
    <span class="application">tar</span> return an error code indistinguishable from a
    fatal error if a file was truncated while <span class="application">tar</span> was
    copying it.  Fortunately, GNU <span class="application">tar</span> versions 1.16 and
    later exits with <code class="literal">1</code> if a file was changed during the backup,
    and <code class="literal">2</code> for other errors.
   </p>
<p>    It is not necessary to be very concerned about the amount of time elapsed
    between <code class="function">pg_start_backup</code> and the start of the actual backup,
    nor between the end of the backup and <code class="function">pg_stop_backup</code>; a
    few minutes' delay won't hurt anything.  (However, if you normally run the
    server with <code class="varname">full_page_writes</code> disabled, you may notice a drop
    in performance between <code class="function">pg_start_backup</code> and 
    <code class="function">pg_stop_backup</code>, since <code class="varname">full_page_writes</code> is
    effectively forced on during backup mode.)  You must ensure that these
    steps are carried out in sequence without any possible
    overlap, or you will invalidate the backup.
   </p>
<p>    Be certain that your backup dump includes all of the files underneath
    the database cluster directory (e.g., <code class="filename">/usr/local/pgsql/data</code>).
    If you are using tablespaces that do not reside underneath this directory,
    be careful to include them as well (and be sure that your backup dump
    archives symbolic links as links, otherwise the restore will mess up
    your tablespaces).
   </p>
<p>    You may, however, omit from the backup dump the files within the
    <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code> subdirectory of the cluster directory.  This
    slight complication is worthwhile because it reduces the risk
    of mistakes when restoring.  This is easy to arrange if
    <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code> is a symbolic link pointing to someplace outside
    the cluster directory, which is a common setup anyway for performance
    reasons.
   </p>
<p>    To make use of the backup, you will need to keep around all the WAL
    segment files generated during and after the file system backup.
    To aid you in doing this, the <code class="function">pg_stop_backup</code> function
    creates a <em class="firstterm">backup history file</em> that is immediately
    stored into the WAL archive area. This file is named after the first
    WAL segment file that you need to have to make use of the backup.
    For example, if the starting WAL file is
    <code class="literal">0000000100001234000055CD</code> the backup history file will be
    named something like
    <code class="literal">0000000100001234000055CD.007C9330.backup</code>. (The second
    number in the file name stands for an exact position within the WAL
    file, and can ordinarily be ignored.) Once you have safely archived
    the file system backup and the WAL segment files used during the
    backup (as specified in the backup history file), all archived WAL
    segments with names numerically less are no longer needed to recover
    the file system backup and may be deleted. However, you should
    consider keeping several backup sets to be absolutely certain that
    you can recover your data.
   </p>
<p>    The backup history file is just a small text file. It contains the
    label string you gave to <code class="function">pg_start_backup</code>, as well as
    the starting and ending times and WAL segments of the backup.
    If you used the label to identify where the associated dump file is kept, 
    then the archived history file is enough to tell you which dump file to
    restore, should you need to do so.
   </p>
<p>    Since you have to keep around all the archived WAL files back to your
    last base backup, the interval between base backups should usually be
    chosen based on how much storage you want to expend on archived WAL
    files.  You should also consider how long you are prepared to spend
    recovering, if recovery should be necessary &#8212; the system will have to
    replay all those WAL segments, and that could take awhile if it has
    been a long time since the last base backup.
   </p>
<p>    It's also worth noting that the <code class="function">pg_start_backup</code> function
    makes a file named <code class="filename">backup_label</code> in the database cluster
    directory, which is then removed again by <code class="function">pg_stop_backup</code>.
    This file will of course be archived as a part of your backup dump file.
    The backup label file includes the label string you gave to
    <code class="function">pg_start_backup</code>, as well as the time at which
    <code class="function">pg_start_backup</code> was run, and the name of the starting WAL
    file.  In case of confusion it will
    therefore be possible to look inside a backup dump file and determine
    exactly which backup session the dump file came from.
   </p>
<p>    It is also possible to make a backup dump while the server is
    stopped.  In this case, you obviously cannot use
    <code class="function">pg_start_backup</code> or <code class="function">pg_stop_backup</code>, and
    you will therefore be left to your own devices to keep track of which
    backup dump is which and how far back the associated WAL files go.
    It is generally better to follow the continuous archiving procedure above.

<p>    Okay, the worst has happened and you need to recover from your backup.
    Here is the procedure:
  </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem"><p>     Stop the server, if it's running.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     If you have the space to do so,
     copy the whole cluster data directory and any tablespaces to a temporary 
     location in case you need them later. Note that this precaution will
     require that you have enough free space on your system to hold two
     copies of your existing database. If you do not have enough space, 
     you need at the least to copy the contents of the <code class="filename">pg_xlog</code>
     subdirectory of the cluster data directory, as it may contain logs which
     were not archived before the system went down.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Clean out all existing files and subdirectories under the cluster data
     directory and under the root directories of any tablespaces you are using.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Restore the database files from your backup dump.  Be careful that they
     are restored with the right ownership (the database system user, not
     root!) and with the right permissions.  If you are using tablespaces,
     you should verify that the symbolic links in <code class="filename">pg_tblspc/</code>
     were correctly restored.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Remove any files present in <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code>; these came from the
     backup dump and are therefore probably obsolete rather than current.
     If you didn't archive <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code> at all, then recreate it,
     and be sure to recreate the subdirectory
    <code class="filename">pg_xlog/archive_status/</code> as well.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     If you had unarchived WAL segment files that you saved in step 2,
     copy them into <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code>.  (It is best to copy them,
     not move them, so that you still have the unmodified files if a
     problem occurs and you have to start over.)
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Create a recovery command file <code class="filename">recovery.conf</code> in the cluster
     data directory (see <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html#recovery-config-settings" title="23.3.3.1. Recovery Settings">Recovery Settings</a>). You may 
     also want to temporarily modify <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> to prevent 
     ordinary users from connecting until you are sure the recovery has worked.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Start the server.  The server will go into recovery mode and
     proceed to read through the archived WAL files it needs.  Should the
     recovery be terminated because of an external error, the server can
     simply be restarted and it will continue recovery.  Upon completion
     of the recovery process, the server will rename
     <code class="filename">recovery.conf</code> to <code class="filename">recovery.done</code> (to prevent
     accidentally re-entering recovery mode in case of a crash later) and then
     commence normal database operations.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     Inspect the contents of the database to ensure you have recovered to
     where you want to be.  If not, return to step 1.  If all is well,
     let in your users by restoring <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> to normal.
    </p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    The key part of all this is to setup a recovery command file that
    describes how you want to recover and how far the recovery should
    run.  You can use <code class="filename">recovery.conf.sample</code> (normally
    installed in the installation <code class="filename">share/</code> directory) as a
    prototype.  The one thing that you absolutely must specify in
    <code class="filename">recovery.conf</code> is the <code class="varname">restore_command</code>,
    which tells <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> how to get back archived
    WAL file segments.  Like the <code class="varname">archive_command</code>, this is
    a shell command string.  It may contain <code class="literal">%f</code>, which is
    replaced by the name of the desired log file, and <code class="literal">%p</code>,
    which is replaced by the path name to copy the log file to.
    (The path name is relative to the working directory of the server,
    i.e., the cluster's data directory.)
    Write <code class="literal">%%</code> if you need to embed an actual <code class="literal">%</code>
    character in the command.  The simplest useful command is
    something like
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">restore_command = 'cp /mnt/server/archivedir/%f %p'</pre>
<p>
    which will copy previously archived WAL segments from the directory
    <code class="filename">/mnt/server/archivedir</code>.  You could of course use something
    much more complicated, perhaps even a shell script that requests the
    operator to mount an appropriate tape.
   </p>
<p>    It is important that the command return nonzero exit status on failure.
    The command <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> be asked for log files that are not present
    in the archive; it must return nonzero when so asked.  This is not an
    error condition.  Be aware also that the base name of the <code class="literal">%p</code>
    path will be different from <code class="literal">%f</code>; do not expect them to be
    interchangeable.
   </p>
<p>    WAL segments that cannot be found in the archive will be sought in
    <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code>; this allows use of recent un-archived segments.
    However segments that are available from the archive will be used in
    preference to files in <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code>.  The system will not
    overwrite the existing contents of <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code> when retrieving
    archived files.
   </p>
<p>    Normally, recovery will proceed through all available WAL segments,
    thereby restoring the database to the current point in time (or as
    close as we can get given the available WAL segments).  But if you want
    to recover to some previous point in time (say, right before the junior
    DBA dropped your main transaction table), just specify the required
    stopping point in <code class="filename">recovery.conf</code>.  You can specify the stop
    point, known as the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">recovery target</span>&#8221;</span>, either by date/time or
    by completion of a specific transaction ID.  As of this writing only
    the date/time option is very usable, since there are no tools to help
    you identify with any accuracy which transaction ID to use.
   </p>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>      The stop point must be after the ending time of the base backup (the
      time of <code class="function">pg_stop_backup</code>).  You cannot use a base backup
      to recover to a time when that backup was still going on.  (To
      recover to such a time, you must go back to your previous base backup
      and roll forward from there.)
     </p>
</div>
<p>    If recovery finds a corruption in the WAL data then recovery will
    complete at that point and the server will not start. In such a case the
    recovery process could be re-run from the beginning, specifying a 
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">recovery target</span>&#8221;</span> before the point of corruption so that recovery
    can complete normally.
    If recovery fails for an external reason, such as a system crash or
    if the WAL archive has become inaccessible, then the recovery can simply
    be restarted and it will restart almost from where it failed.
    Recovery restart works much like checkpointing in normal operation:
    the server periodically forces all its state to disk, and then updates
    the <code class="filename">pg_control</code> file to indicate that the already-processed
    WAL data need not be scanned again.

      file, and apply only for the duration of the recovery. They must be
      reset for any subsequent recovery you wish to perform. They cannot be

<a name="id2696479"></a><p>    The ability to restore the database to a previous point in time creates
    some complexities that are akin to science-fiction stories about time
    travel and parallel universes.  In the original history of the database,
    perhaps you dropped a critical table at 5:15PM on Tuesday evening.
    Unfazed, you get out your backup, restore to the point-in-time 5:14PM
    Tuesday evening, and are up and running.  In <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> history of
    the database universe, you never dropped the table at all.  But suppose
    you later realize this wasn't such a great idea after all, and would like
    to return to some later point in the original history.  You won't be able
    to if, while your database was up-and-running, it overwrote some of the
    sequence of WAL segment files that led up to the time you now wish you
    could get back to.  So you really want to distinguish the series of
    WAL records generated after you've done a point-in-time recovery from
    those that were generated in the original database history.
   </p>
<p>    To deal with these problems, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> has a notion
    of <em class="firstterm">timelines</em>.  Whenever an archive recovery is completed,
    a new timeline is created to identify the series of WAL records
    generated after that recovery.  The timeline
    ID number is part of WAL segment file names, and so a new timeline does
    not overwrite the WAL data generated by previous timelines.  It is
    in fact possible to archive many different timelines.  While that might
    seem like a useless feature, it's often a lifesaver.  Consider the
    situation where you aren't quite sure what point-in-time to recover to,
    and so have to do several point-in-time recoveries by trial and error
    until you find the best place to branch off from the old history.  Without
    timelines this process would soon generate an unmanageable mess.  With
    timelines, you can recover to <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> prior state, including
    states in timeline branches that you later abandoned.
   </p>
<p>    Each time a new timeline is created, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> creates
    a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">timeline history</span>&#8221;</span> file that shows which timeline it branched
    off from and when.  These history files are necessary to allow the system
    to pick the right WAL segment files when recovering from an archive that
    contains multiple timelines.  Therefore, they are archived into the WAL
    archive area just like WAL segment files.  The history files are just
    small text files, so it's cheap and appropriate to keep them around
    indefinitely (unlike the segment files which are large).  You can, if
    you like, add comments to a history file to make your own notes about
    how and why this particular timeline came to be.  Such comments will be
    especially valuable when you have a thicket of different timelines as
    a result of experimentation.
   </p>
<p>    The default behavior of recovery is to recover along the same timeline
    that was current when the base backup was taken.  If you want to recover
    into some child timeline (that is, you want to return to some state that
    was itself generated after a recovery attempt), you need to specify the
    target timeline ID in <code class="filename">recovery.conf</code>.  You cannot recover into
    timelines that branched off earlier than the base backup.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="continuous-archiving-caveats">23.3.5. Caveats</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    At this writing, there are several limitations of the continuous archiving
    technique.  These will probably be fixed in future releases:

  </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>     Operations on hash indexes are not presently WAL-logged, so
     replay will not update these indexes.  The recommended workaround
     is to manually <a class="xref" href="sql-reindex.html" title="REINDEX">REINDEX</a>
     each such index after completing a recovery operation.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     If a <a class="xref" href="sql-createdatabase.html" title="CREATE DATABASE">CREATE DATABASE</a>
     command is executed while a base backup is being taken, and then
     the template database that the <code class="command">CREATE DATABASE</code> copied
     is modified while the base backup is still in progress, it is
     possible that recovery will cause those modifications to be
     propagated into the created database as well.  This is of course
     undesirable.  To avoid this risk, it is best not to modify any
     template databases while taking a base backup.
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>     <a class="xref" href="sql-createtablespace.html" title="CREATE TABLESPACE">CREATE TABLESPACE</a>
     commands are WAL-logged with the literal absolute path, and will
     therefore be replayed as tablespace creations with the same
     absolute path.  This might be undesirable if the log is being
     replayed on a different machine.  It can be dangerous even if the
     log is being replayed on the same machine, but into a new data
     directory: the replay will still overwrite the contents of the
     original tablespace.  To avoid potential gotchas of this sort,
     the best practice is to take a new base backup after creating or
     dropping tablespaces.
    </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    It should also be noted that the default <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym>
    format is fairly bulky since it includes many disk page snapshots.
    These page snapshots are designed to support crash recovery, since
    we may need to fix partially-written disk pages.  Depending on
    your system hardware and software, the risk of partial writes may
    be small enough to ignore, in which case you can significantly
    reduce the total volume of archived logs by turning off page
    snapshots using the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#guc-full-page-writes">full_page_writes</a>
    parameter.  (Read the notes and warnings in <a class="xref" href="wal.html" title="Chapter 27. Reliability and the Write-Ahead Log">Chapter 27, <i>Reliability and the Write-Ahead Log</i></a>
    before you do so.)  Turning off page snapshots does not prevent
    use of the logs for PITR operations.  An area for future
    development is to compress archived WAL data by removing
    unnecessary page copies even when <code class="varname">full_page_writes</code> is
    on.  In the meantime, administrators may wish to reduce the number
    of page snapshots included in WAL by increasing the checkpoint
    interval parameters as much as feasible.
