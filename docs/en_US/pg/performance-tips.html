<a name="id2658634"></a><p>   Query performance can be affected by many things. Some of these can 
   be manipulated by the user, while others are fundamental to the underlying
   design of the system.  This chapter provides some hints about understanding
   and tuning <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> performance.
  </p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="using-explain">13.1. Using <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code></h2></div></div></div>
<a name="id2658668"></a><a name="id2658677"></a><p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> devises a <em class="firstterm">query
    plan</em> for each query it is given.  Choosing the right
    plan to match the query structure and the properties of the data
    is absolutely critical for good performance, so the system includes
    a complex <em class="firstterm">planner</em> that tries to select good plans.
    You can use the
    <a class="xref" href="sql-explain.html" title="EXPLAIN">EXPLAIN</a> command
    to see what query plan the planner creates for any query.
    Plan-reading is an art that deserves an extensive tutorial, which
    this is not; but here is some basic information.
   </p>
<p>    The structure of a query plan is a tree of <em class="firstterm">plan nodes</em>.
    Nodes at the bottom level are table scan nodes: they return raw rows
    from a table.  There are different types of scan nodes for different
    table access methods: sequential scans, index scans, and bitmap index
    scans.  If the query requires joining, aggregation, sorting, or other
    operations on the raw rows, then there will be additional nodes
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">atop</span>&#8221;</span> the scan nodes to perform these operations.  Again,
    there is usually more than one possible way to do these operations,
    so different node types can appear here too.  The output
    of <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> has one line for each node in the plan
    tree, showing the basic node type plus the cost estimates that the planner
    made for the execution of that plan node.  The first line (topmost node)
    has the estimated total execution cost for the plan; it is this number
    that the planner seeks to minimize.
   </p>
<p>    Here is a trivial example, just to show what the output looks like.
    <sup>[<a name="id2658752" href="#ftn.id2658752" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup>

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1;

                         QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..458.00 rows=10000 width=244)</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    The numbers that are quoted by <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> are:

    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>       Estimated start-up cost (Time expended before output scan can start,
       e.g., time to do the sorting in a sort node.)
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>       Estimated total cost (If all rows were to be retrieved, which they may
       not be: for example, a query with a <code class="literal">LIMIT</code> clause will stop
       short of paying the total cost of the <code class="literal">Limit</code> plan node's
       input node.)
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>       Estimated number of rows output by this plan node (Again, only if
       executed to completion.)
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>       Estimated average width (in bytes) of rows output by this plan
       node
      </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    The costs are measured in arbitrary units determined by the planner's
    cost parameters (see <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query.html#runtime-config-query-constants" title="17.6.2.  Planner Cost Constants">Section 17.6.2, &#8220;      Planner Cost Constants
     &#8221;</a>).
    Traditional practice is to measure the costs in units of disk page
    fetches; that is, <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query.html#guc-seq-page-cost">seq_page_cost</a> is conventionally
    set to <code class="literal">1.0</code> and the other cost parameters are set relative
    to that.  The examples in this section are run with the default cost
    parameters.
   </p>
<p>    It's important to note that the cost of an upper-level node includes
    the cost of all its child nodes.  It's also important to realize that
    the cost only reflects things that the planner cares about.
    In particular, the cost does not consider the time spent transmitting
    result rows to the client, which could be an important
    factor in the true elapsed time; but the planner ignores it because
    it cannot change it by altering the plan.  (Every correct plan will
    output the same row set, we trust.)
   </p>
<p>    Rows output is a little tricky because it is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the
    number of rows processed or scanned by the plan node.  It is usually less,
    reflecting the estimated selectivity of any <code class="literal">WHERE</code>-clause
    conditions that are being 
    applied at the node.  Ideally the top-level rows estimate will
    approximate the number of rows actually returned, updated, or deleted
    by the query.
   </p>
<p>    Returning to our example:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1;

                         QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..458.00 rows=10000 width=244)</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    This is about as straightforward as it gets.  If you do

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT relpages, reltuples FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'tenk1';</pre>
<p>

    you will find out that <code class="classname">tenk1</code> has 358 disk
    pages and 10000 rows.  So the cost is estimated at 358 page
    reads, costing <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query.html#guc-seq-page-cost">seq_page_cost</a> apiece (1.0 by
    default), plus 10000 * <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query.html#guc-cpu-tuple-cost">cpu_tuple_cost</a> which is
    0.01 by default.
   </p>
<p>    Now let's modify the query to add a <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 7000;

                         QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..483.00 rows=7033 width=244)
   Filter: (unique1 &lt; 7000)</pre>
<p>

    Notice that the <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> output shows the <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
    clause being applied as a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">filter</span>&#8221;</span> condition; this means that
    the plan node checks the condition for each row it scans, and outputs
    only the ones that pass the condition.
    The estimate of output rows has gone down because of the <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
    clause.
    However, the scan will still have to visit all 10000 rows, so the cost
    hasn't decreased; in fact it has gone up a bit to reflect the extra CPU
    time spent checking the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition.
   </p>
<p>    The actual number of rows this query would select is 7000, but the rows
    estimate is only approximate.  If you try to duplicate this experiment,
    you will probably get a slightly different estimate; moreover, it will
    change after each <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> command, because the
    statistics produced by <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> are taken from a
    randomized sample of the table.
   </p>
<p>    Now, let's make the condition more restrictive:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100;

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=2.37..232.35 rows=106 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..2.37 rows=106 width=0)
         Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)</pre>
<p>

    Here the planner has decided to use a two-step plan: the bottom plan
    node visits an index to find the locations of rows matching the index
    condition, and then the upper plan node actually fetches those rows
    from the table itself.  Fetching the rows separately is much more
    expensive than sequentially reading them, but because not all the pages
    of the table have to be visited, this is still cheaper than a sequential
    scan.  (The reason for using two levels of plan is that the upper plan
    node sorts the row locations identified by the index into physical order
    before reading them, so as to minimize the costs of the separate fetches.
    The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bitmap</span>&#8221;</span> mentioned in the node names is the mechanism that
    does the sorting.)
   </p>
<p>    If the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition is selective enough, the planner may
    switch to a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">simple</span>&#8221;</span> index scan plan:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 3;

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.00..10.00 rows=2 width=244)
   Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 3)</pre>
<p>

    In this case the table rows are fetched in index order, which makes them
    even more expensive to read, but there are so few that the extra cost
    of sorting the row locations is not worth it.  You'll most often see
    this plan type for queries that fetch just a single row, and for queries
    that request an <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> condition that matches the index
    order.
   </p>
<p>    Add another condition to the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 3 AND stringu1 = 'xxx';

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.00..10.01 rows=1 width=244)
   Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 3)
   Filter: (stringu1 = 'xxx'::name)</pre>
<p>

    The added condition <code class="literal">stringu1 = 'xxx'</code> reduces the
    output-rows estimate, but not the cost because we still have to visit the
    same set of rows.  Notice that the <code class="literal">stringu1</code> clause
    cannot be applied as an index condition (since this index is only on
    the <code class="literal">unique1</code> column).  Instead it is applied as a filter on
    the rows retrieved by the index.  Thus the cost has actually gone up
    a little bit to reflect this extra checking.
   </p>
<p>    If there are indexes on several columns used in <code class="literal">WHERE</code>, the
    planner might choose to use an AND or OR combination of the indexes:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100 AND unique2 &gt; 9000;

                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=11.27..49.11 rows=11 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: ((unique1 &lt; 100) AND (unique2 &gt; 9000))
   -&gt;  BitmapAnd  (cost=11.27..11.27 rows=11 width=0)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..2.37 rows=106 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique2  (cost=0.00..8.65 rows=1042 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique2 &gt; 9000)</pre>
<p>

    But this requires visiting both indexes, so it's not necessarily a win
    compared to using just one index and treating the other condition as
    a filter.  If you vary the ranges involved you'll see the plan change
    accordingly.
   </p>
<p>    Let's try joining two tables, using the columns we have been discussing:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2 WHERE t1.unique1 &lt; 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;

                                      QUERY PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=2.37..553.11 rows=106 width=488)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1 t1  (cost=2.37..232.35 rows=106 width=244)
         Recheck Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..2.37 rows=106 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using tenk2_unique2 on tenk2 t2  (cost=0.00..3.01 rows=1 width=244)
         Index Cond: ("outer".unique2 = t2.unique2)</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    In this nested-loop join, the outer scan is the same bitmap index scan we
    saw earlier, and so its cost and row count are the same because we are
    applying the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause <code class="literal">unique1 &lt; 100</code>
    at that node.
    The <code class="literal">t1.unique2 = t2.unique2</code> clause is not relevant yet,
    so it doesn't affect row count of the outer scan.  For the inner scan, the
    <code class="literal">unique2</code> value of the current outer-scan row is plugged into
    the inner index scan to produce an index condition like
    <code class="literal">t2.unique2 = <em class="replaceable"><code>constant</code></em></code>.
    So we get the same inner-scan plan and costs that we'd get from, say,
    <code class="literal">EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk2 WHERE unique2 = 42</code>.  The
    costs of the loop node are then set on the basis of the cost of the outer
    scan, plus one repetition of the inner scan for each outer row (106 * 3.01,
    here), plus a little CPU time for join processing.
   </p>
<p>    In this example the join's output row count is the same as the product
    of the two scans' row counts, but that's not true in general, because
    in general you can have <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clauses that mention both tables
    and so can only be applied at the join point, not to either input scan.
    For example, if we added
    <code class="literal">WHERE ... AND t1.hundred &lt; t2.hundred</code>,
    that would decrease the output row count of the join node, but not change
    either input scan.
   </p>
<p>    One way to look at variant plans is to force the planner to disregard
    whatever strategy it thought was the winner, using the enable/disable
    flags described in <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query.html#runtime-config-query-enable" title="17.6.1. Planner Method Configuration">Section 17.6.1, &#8220;Planner Method Configuration&#8221;</a>.
    (This is a crude tool, but useful.  See
    also <a class="xref" href="explicit-joins.html" title="13.3. Controlling the Planner with Explicit JOIN Clauses">Section 13.3, &#8220;Controlling the Planner with Explicit <code class="literal">JOIN</code> Clauses&#8221;</a>.)

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET enable_nestloop = off;
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2 WHERE t1.unique1 &lt; 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;

                                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=232.61..741.67 rows=106 width=488)

<p>

    This plan proposes to extract the 100 interesting rows of <code class="classname">tenk1</code>
    using that same old index scan, stash them into an in-memory hash table,
    and then do a sequential scan of <code class="classname">tenk2</code>, probing into the hash table
    for possible matches of <code class="literal">t1.unique2 = t2.unique2</code> at each <code class="classname">tenk2</code> row.
    The cost to read <code class="classname">tenk1</code> and set up the hash table is entirely start-up
    cost for the hash join, since we won't get any rows out until we can
    start reading <code class="classname">tenk2</code>.  The total time estimate for the join also
    includes a hefty charge for the CPU time to probe the hash table
    10000 times.  Note, however, that we are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> charging 10000 times 232.35;
    the hash table setup is only done once in this plan type.
   </p>
<p>    It is possible to check on the accuracy of the planner's estimated costs
    by using <code class="command">EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>.  This command actually executes the query,
    and then displays the true run time accumulated within each plan node
    along with the same estimated costs that a plain <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> shows.
    For example, we might get a result like this:

</p>
<pre class="screen">EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2 WHERE t1.unique1 &lt; 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;

 Nested Loop  (cost=2.37..553.11 rows=106 width=488) (actual time=1.392..12.700 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1 t1  (cost=2.37..232.35 rows=106 width=244) (actual time=0.878..2.367 rows=100 loops=1)

         Index Cond: ("outer".unique2 = t2.unique2)
 Total runtime: 14.452 ms</pre>
<p>

    Note that the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">actual time</span>&#8221;</span> values are in milliseconds of
    real time, whereas the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cost</span>&#8221;</span> estimates are expressed in
    arbitrary units; so they are unlikely to match up.
    The thing to pay attention to is whether the ratios of actual time and
    estimated costs are consistent.
   </p>
<p>    In some query plans, it is possible for a subplan node to be executed more
    than once.  For example, the inner index scan is executed once per outer
    row in the above nested-loop plan.  In such cases, the
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">loops</span>&#8221;</span> value reports the
    total number of executions of the node, and the actual time and rows
    values shown are averages per-execution.  This is done to make the numbers
    comparable with the way that the cost estimates are shown.  Multiply by
    the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">loops</span>&#8221;</span> value to get the total time actually spent in
    the node.
   </p>
<p>    The <code class="literal">Total runtime</code> shown by <code class="command">EXPLAIN
    ANALYZE</code> includes executor start-up and shut-down time, as well
    as time spent processing the result rows.  It does not include parsing,
    rewriting, or planning time.  For a <code class="command">SELECT</code> query, the total
    run time will normally be just a little larger than the total time
    reported for the top-level plan node.  For <code class="command">INSERT</code>,
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, and <code class="command">DELETE</code> commands, the total run time
    may be considerably larger, because it includes the time spent processing
    the result rows.  In these commands, the time for the top plan node
    essentially is the time spent computing the new rows and/or locating the
    old ones, but it doesn't include the time spent applying the changes.
    Time spent firing triggers, if any, is also outside the top plan node,
    and is shown separately for each trigger.

<p>    It is worth noting that <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> results should not be extrapolated
    to situations other than the one you are actually testing; for example,
    results on a toy-sized table can't be assumed to apply to large tables.
    The planner's cost estimates are not linear and so it may well choose
    a different plan for a larger or smaller table.  An extreme example
    is that on a table that only occupies one disk page, you'll nearly
    always get a sequential scan plan whether indexes are available or not.
    The planner realizes that it's going to take one disk page read to
    process the table in any case, so there's no value in expending additional
    page reads to look at an index.

<div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2658752" href="#id2658752" class="para">7</a>] </sup>      Examples in this section are drawn from the regression test database
      after doing a <code class="command">VACUUM ANALYZE</code>, using 8.2 development sources.
      You should be able to get similar results if you try the examples yourself,
      but your estimated costs and row counts will probably vary slightly
      because <code class="command">ANALYZE</code>'s statistics are random samples rather
      than being exact.
